For precise planning and judicious use of available water resources for agricultural operations and aquatic habitats, it is critical to assess the dam water’s temperature accurately. The building of dams, particularly several dams in rivers, can significantly impact downstream water. In this study, we predict the daily water temperature of the Yangtze River at Cuntan. Thus, this work reveals the potential of machine learning models, namely, M5 Pruned (M5P), Random Forest (RF), Random Subspace (RSS), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). The best and effective input variables combinations were determined based on the correlation coefficient. The outputs of the various machine learning algorithm models were compared with recorded daily water temperature data using goodness-of-fit criteria and graphical analysis to arrive at a final comparison. Based on a number of criteria, numerical comparison between the models revealed that M5P model performed superior (R2 = 0.9920, 0.9708; PCC = 0.9960, 0.9853; MAE = 0.2387, 0.4285; RMSE = 0.3449, 0.4285; RAE = 6.2573, 11.5439; RRSE = 8.0288, 13.8282) in pre-impact and post-impact spam, respectively. These findings suggest that a huge wave of dam construction in the previous century altered the hydrologic regimes of large and minor rivers. This study will be helpful for the ecologists and river experts in planning new reservoirs to maintain the flows and minimize the water temperature concerning spillway operation. Finally, our findings revealed that these algorithms could reliably estimate water temperature using a day lag time input in water level. They are cost-effective techniques for forecasting purposes.",We also wish to thank the China Hydrological Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission and the China Meteorological Administration for providing data for this study.

Most oil and gas companies use reservoir simulation software to predict future oil and gas production and devise optimum field development plans. However, this process costs an immense number of resources and is time consuming. Each reservoir prediction experiment needs tens or hundreds of simulation runs, taking several hours or days to finish. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these issues by creating machine learning and deep learning models to expedite the process of forecasting oil and gas production. The dataset was provided by the leading oil producer, Saudi Aramco. Our approach reduced the time costs to a worst-case of a few minutes. Our study covered eight different ML and DL experiments and achieved its most outstanding R2 scores of 0.96 for XGBoost, 0.97 for ANN, and 0.98 for RNN over the other experiments.","We would like to acknowledge Saudi Aramco for providing us with the required assistance with the dataset, Ali Al-Turki and Osaid Hajjar.",This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,"Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Software; Water",2022-07-16,2022,2022-07-16,,22,14,5326,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ibrahim, Nehad M; Alharbi, Ali A; Alzahrani, Turki A; Abdulkarim, Abdullah M; Alessa, Ibrahim A; Hameed, Abdullah M; Albabtain, Abdullaziz S; Alqahtani, Deemah A; Alsawwaf, Mohammad K; Almuqhim, Abdullah A","Ibrahim, Nehad M (Department of Computer Science, College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, P.O.

Oil and gas (O&G) fields are getting mature, where well integrity (WI) problems become more common and field operations are now more challenging. Hence, they are good candidates for transformation due to the low cost of data storage, highlighting the oil market decline, along with dynamic risk posed during operations. This paper is presenting a comprehensive compilation of different ML applications in diverse disciplines of the petroleum industry. The pool of AI and ML with respect to different areas of applications along with publication years has been categorized. The main focus of this study is classifying well integrity failures where the authors found that the potential of AI and ML in predicting well integrity failures has not been efficiently tapped, and there is an explicit gap in the literature. First, the applications of AI, ML, and data analytics in the O&G industry are discussed thoroughly, so this paper can be a comprehensive reference for readers and future researchers. Then data preprocessing is explained. This includes data gathering, cleaning, and feature engineering. Next, the different ML models are compared and discussed. Finally, model performance evaluation and best model selection are described. This study would be a concrete foundation in the design and construction of ML programs that can be deployed for WI risk management. The developed model can be simply used for any well stock, providing quick and easy assessment instead of subjective and tedious assessment. The layout can be simply adjusted to reflect the risk profile of any well type or any field.","The authors would like to express appreciation for the support of the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO) and permission to publish this work.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an effective tool for addressing these challenges. Therefore, for decades, an increasing number of researchers have begun to conduct AI research in the field of geohazards leading to rapid growth in the number of related papers. This has made it difficult for researchers and practitioners to grasp information on cutting-edge developments in the field, thus necessitating a comprehensive review and analysis of the current state of development in the field. In this study, a comprehensive scientometric analysis appraising the state-of-the-art research for geohazard was performed based on 9226 scientometric records from the Web of Science core collection database. Multiple types of scientometric techniques, including coauthor analysis, co-citation analysis, and cluster analysis were employed to identify the most productive researchers, institutions, and hot research topics. The results show that research related to the application of AI in the field of geohazards experienced a period of rapid growth after 2000, with major developments in the field occurring in China, the United States, and Italy. The hot research topics in this field are ground motion, deep learning (DL), and landslides. The commonly used AI algorithms include DL, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). The obtained visualization on research networks offers valuable insights and an in-depth understanding of the key researchers, institutions, fundamental articles, and salient topics through animated maps. We believe that this scientometric review offers useful reference points for early-stage researchers and provides valuable in-depth information to experienced researchers and practitioners in the field of geohazard research. This scientometric analysis and visualization are promising for reflecting the global picture of AI-based geohazard research comprehensively and possess potential for the visualization of the emerging trends in other research fields.",,"This research was funded by the Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42090055), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 42177147 and 71874165), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (CUG2642022006).",Sensors,,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Research Personnel; Italy; China,2022-10-14,2022,2022-10-14,,22,20,7814,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jiang, Sheng; Ma, Junwei; Liu, Zhiyang; Guo, Haixiang","Jiang, Sheng (Badong National Observation and Research Station of Geohazards (BNORSG), China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China; Three Gorges Research Center for Geohazards of the Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China); Ma, Junwei (Badong National Observation and Research Station of Geohazards (BNORSG), China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China; Three Gorges Research Center for Geohazards of the Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China); Liu, Zhiyang (Badong National Observation and Research Station of Geohazards (BNORSG), China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China; Three Gorges Research Center for Geohazards of the Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China); Guo, Haixiang (School of Economics and Management, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China)","Ma, Junwei (China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences)","Jiang, Sheng (China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences); Ma, Junwei (China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences); Liu, Zhiyang (China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences); Guo, Haixiang (China University of Geosciences)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/20/7814/pdf?version=1665989254,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151973267,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a heat-trapping (greenhouse) that is released into the earth’s atmosphere from natural processes, such as volcanic respiration and eruptions, as well as human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Due to this fact, underground carbon storage (UCS) is a promising technology to cut carbon emissions. However, there are some barriers to prevent UCS from applying globally. One of them is evaluating the feasibility of storage projects. Thus, the prediction accuracy of CO2 storage efficiencies may promote the attention of the community for UCS. In this study, we utilize the recent advances of swarm intelligence to develop a hybrid algorithm called AOSMA, employed to train the long short-term memory (LSTM). The developed swarm intelligence method (AOSMA) is an enhanced Aquila optimizer (AO) using the search mechanism of the slime mould algorithm (SMA). It is used to boost the prediction capability of the LSTM by optimizing its parameters. We considered two CO2 trapping indices, called residual trapping index (RTI) and solubility trapping index (STI). The evaluation experiments have shown that the AOSMA achieved significant results compared to the original AO and SMA and several swarm intelligence and optimization algorithms. The developed smart tools could use as a game changer to provide fast and accurate storage efficiency for projects that have similar parameters falling within the range of the database.",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62150410434).,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,"Humans; Carbon Dioxide; Memory, Short-Term; Air Pollution; Fossil Fuels; Groundwater",2022-12-10,2022,2022-12-10,2023-03,30,12,33780-33794,Closed,Article,"Al-qaness, Mohammed A.

The close monitoring for rheological properties will help the drilling fluid crew to take quick actions to maintain the designed profiles for the drilling fluid rheology, especially when it comes to the flat rheology drilling fluid system, which is a new generation for harsh and specific drilling conditions that require flat profiles for the mud rheology regarding the temperature condition changes. The current study introduces a machine learning application toward predicting the rheology of synthetic oil-based mud (flat rheology type) for the full automation system of monitoring the mud rheological properties. Four models are developed, for the first time, to determine the rheological characteristics of flat rheology synthetic oil-based system using artificial neural networks. The developed models are capable of predicting the plastic and apparent viscosities, yield point, and flow behavior index from only the mud density and Marsh funnel as model inputs. The proposed models were trained and optimized from a real field dataset (369 measurements) with further testing the models using an unseen dataset of 153 data points. The predicted rheological properties achieved a high degree of accuracy versus the actual measurements and showed a coefficient of correlation range from 0.91 to 0.97 with an average absolute percentage error of less than 9.66% during the training and testing phases.

The accurate prediction of the recovery rate is very important for measuring reservoir development effects and dynamic analysis. Traditional tight oil recovery predictions are obtained by conventional formula calculations and curve fitting, which are less applicable and very different from actual conditions. Machine learning can make accurate predictions based on a large amount of data, so it is used to predict the recovery rate of tight oil reservoirs. The recovery rate of 200 wells in M tight oil reservoirs ranges widely between 8.8 and 27.6%, with more than 14 factors affecting the recovery rate, and the overall declining rule is not clear. Therefore, this research combines the production data of horizontal wells with random forest, support vector regression (SVR), and other methods, establishing recovery prediction models to gain more accurate recovery predictions. First, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the random forest (RF) machine learning method are used to measure and calculate the degree of nonlinear influence of factors on oil well recovery. Second, SVR and optimization of support vector regression by particle swarm (PSO-SVR) recovery prediction models are developed and tested, with 75% of the data being used to train SVR and PSO-SVR recovery prediction models and 25% to verify the model. Third, the accuracy of the results of these two SVR oil recovery prediction models is compared, suggesting that when the data are scarce, the optimized model is more accurate than the unoptimized one by 10.85%. Thus, this model can assure a relatively more accurate prediction of oil recovery. Machine learning recovery prediction, being more accurate and applicable, enables the data of factors such as construction and production systems to be optimized in the future, enhancing the oil recovery rate.",This work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51974329).,,ACS Omega,,,2021-11-16,2021,2021-11-16,2021-11-30,6,47,32142-32150,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huang, Shihui; Tian, Leng; Zhang, Jinshui; Chai, Xiaolong; Wang, Hengli; Zhang, Hongling","Huang, Shihui (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China; Department of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China); Tian, Leng (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China; Department of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China); Zhang, Jinshui (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China; Department of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China); Chai, Xiaolong (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China; Department of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China); Wang, Hengli (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China; Department of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China); Zhang, Hongling (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China; Department of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing, 102249, China)","Tian, Leng (China University of Petroleum, Beijing; China University of Petroleum, Beijing)","Huang, Shihui (China University of Petroleum, Beijing; China University of Petroleum, Beijing); Tian, Leng (China University of Petroleum, Beijing; China University of Petroleum, Beijing); Zhang, Jinshui (China University of Petroleum, Beijing; China University of Petroleum, Beijing); Chai, Xiaolong (China University of Petroleum, Beijing; China University of Petroleum, Beijing); Wang, Hengli (China University of Petroleum, Beijing; China University of Petroleum, Beijing); Zhang, Hongling (China University of Petroleum, Beijing; China University of Petroleum, Beijing)",2,2,0.81,0.87,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8638026,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142625081,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Since this type of erosion develops internally and silently, methodologies of data acquisition and processing for dam monitoring are crucial to guarantee a safe operation during the lifespan of these structures. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques show up as tools that can simplify the analysis and verification process not of the internal erosion itself, but of the effects that this pathology causes in the response of the dam to external stimuli. Therefore, within the scope of this paper, a methodological framework for monitoring internal erosion in the body of earth and rockfill dams will be proposed. For that, artificial intelligence methods, especially deep neural autoencoders, will be used to treat the acoustic data collected by geophones installed on a dam. The sensor data is processed to identify patterns and anomalies as well as to classify the dam's structural health status. In short, the acoustic dataset is preprocessed to reduce its dimensionality. In this process, for each second of acquired data, three parameters are calculated (Hjorth parameters). For each parameter, the data from all the available sensors are used to calibrate an autoencoder. Then, the reconstruction error of each autoencoder is used to monitor how far from the original (normal) state the acoustic signature of the dam is. The time series of reconstruction errors are combined with a cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm, which indicates changes in the sequential data collected. Additionally, the outputs of the CUSUM algorithms are treated by a fuzzy logic framework to predict the status of the structure. A scale model is built and monitored to check the effectiveness of the methodology hereby developed, showing that the existence of anomalies is promptly detected by the algorithm. The framework introduced in the present paper aims to detect internal erosion inside dams by combining different techniques in a novel context and methodological workflow. Therefore, this paper seeks to close gaps in prior studies, which mostly treated just parts of the data acquisition-processing workflow.",The authors acknowledge the support provided by the University of Brasilia (UnB).,,Sensors,,"Acoustics; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Fuzzy Logic; Neural Networks, Computer",2022-03-24,2022,2022-03-24,,22,7,2482,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ozelim, Luan Carlos de Sena Monteiro; Borges, Lucas Parreira de Faria; Cavalcante, André Luís Brasil; Albuquerque, Enzo Aldo Cunha; Diniz, Mariana Dos Santos; Góis, Manuelle Santos; Costa, Katherin Rocio Cano Bezerra da; Sousa, Patrícia Figuereido de; Dantas, Ana Paola do Nascimento; Jorge, Rafael Mendes; Moreira, Gabriela Rodrigues; Barros, Matheus Lima de; Aquino, Fernando Rodrigo de","Ozelim, Luan Carlos de Sena Monteiro (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Borges, Lucas Parreira de Faria (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Cavalcante, André Luís Brasil (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Albuquerque, Enzo Aldo Cunha (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Diniz, Mariana Dos Santos (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Góis, Manuelle Santos (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Costa, Katherin Rocio Cano Bezerra da (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Sousa, Patrícia Figuereido de (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Dantas, Ana Paola do Nascimento (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Jorge, Rafael Mendes (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Moreira, Gabriela Rodrigues (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Barros, Matheus Lima de (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.); Aquino, Fernando Rodrigo de (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.)","Ozelim, Luan Carlos de Sena Monteiro (University of Brasília)","Ozelim, Luan Carlos de Sena Monteiro (University of Brasília); Borges, Lucas Parreira de Faria (University of Brasília); Cavalcante, André Luís Brasil (University of Brasília); Albuquerque, Enzo Aldo Cunha (University of Brasília); Diniz, Mariana Dos Santos (University of Brasília); Góis, Manuelle Santos (University of Brasília); Costa, Katherin Rocio Cano Bezerra da (University of Brasília); Sousa, Patrícia Figuereido de (University of Brasília); Dantas, Ana Paola do Nascimento (University of Brasília); Jorge, Rafael Mendes (University of Brasília); Moreira, Gabriela Rodrigues (University of Brasília); Barros, Matheus Lima de (University of Brasília); Aquino, Fernando Rodrigo de (University of Brasília)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/7/2482/pdf?version=1648777129,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146537432,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

EUR estimation is a critical process to evaluate the well profitability. This study proposes the use of different machine learning techniques to predict the EUR as a function of the completion design including the lateral length, the number of stages, the total injected proppant and slurry volumes, and the maximum treating pressure measured during the fracturing operations. A data set of 200 well production data and completion designs was collected from oil production wells in the Niobrara shale formation. Artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) techniques were implemented to predict EUR from the completion design. The results showed a low accuracy of direct prediction of the EUR from the completion design. Hence, an intermediate step of estimating the initial well production rate (Q i ) from the completion data was carried out, and then, the Q i and the completion design were used as input parameters to predict the EUR. The ANN and RF models accurately predicted the EUR from the completion design data and the estimated Q i . The correlation coefficient (R) values between actual EUR and predicted EUR from the ANN model were 0.96 and 0.95 compared with 0.99 and 0.95 from the RF model for training and testing, respectively. A new correlation was developed based on the weight and biases from the optimized ANN model with an R value of 0.95. This study provides ML application with an empirical correlation to predict the EUR from the completion design parameters at an early time without the need for complex numerical simulation analysis. The developed models require only the initial flow rate along with the completion design to predict EUR with high certainty without the need for several months of production similar to the DCA models.",The authors of this article would like to acknowledge the support provided by King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals (KFUPM) to publish this work.,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Machine Learning; Oil and Gas Fields,2022-06-21,2022,2022-06-21,2022-06-21,2022,,7084514,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid; Alarifi, Sulaiman A; Elkatatny, Salaheldin","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (Department of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa; Center for Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa); Alarifi, Sulaiman A (Department of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa; Center for Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa; Center for Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa)","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Alarifi, Sulaiman A (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",1,1,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/7084514.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148843126,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The conventional methods for determining the rock porosity are considered costly and time-consuming operations during the well drilling. This paper aims to predict the rock porosity in real time while drilling complex lithology using machine learning. In this paper, two intelligent models were developed utilizing the random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) techniques. The drilling parameters include weight on bit, torque, standpipe pressure, drill string rotation speed, rate of penetration, and pump rate. Two datasets were employed for building the models (3767 data points) and for validating the developed models (1676 data points). Both collected datasets have complex lithology of carbonate, sandstone, and shale. Sensitivity and optimization on different parameters for each technique were conducted to ensure optimum prediction. The models' performance was checked by four performance indices which are coefficient of determination (R 2), average absolute percentage error (AAPE), variance account for (VAF), and a20 index. The results indicated the strong porosity prediction capability for the two models. DT model showed R 2 of 0.94 and 0.87 between the predicted and actual porosity values with AAPE of 6.07 and 9% for training and testing, respectively. Generally, RF provided a higher level of strong prediction than DT as RF achieved R 2 of 0.99 and 0.90 with AAPE of 1.5 and 7% for training and testing, respectively. The models' validation proved a high prediction performance as DT achieved R 2 of 0.88 and AAPE of 8.58%, while RF has R 2 of 0.92 and AAPE of 6.5%.",The authors acknowledge King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals for permitting to publish this work.,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Machine Learning; Porosity; Rotation,2021-06-14,2021,2021-06-14,2021-06-14,2021,,9960478,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gamal, Hany; Elkatatny, Salaheldin; Alsaihati, Ahmed; Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez","Gamal, Hany (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa); Alsaihati, Ahmed (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa); Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Gamal, Hany (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Alsaihati, Ahmed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",12,12,1.67,5.77,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9960478,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138899848,37 Earth Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

The neural networks have been explored in the time series prediction, but the problem remains in modeling the data's nonstationary and nonlinear features. Referring to the time series feature and network property, a novel network is designed with dynamic optimization of the model structure. Firstly, the echo state network (ESN) is introduced into the broad learning system (BLS). The broad echo state network (BESN) can increase the training efficiency with the incremental learning algorithm by removing the error backpropagation. Secondly, an optimization algorithm is proposed to reduce the redundant information in the training process of BESN units. The number of neurons in BESN with a fixed step size is pruned according to the contribution degree. Finally, the improved network is applied in the different datasets. The tests in the time series of natural and man-made systems prove that the proposed network performs better on the nonstationary time series prediction than the typical methods, including the ESN, BLS, and recurrent neural network.","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFC1606801), National Natural Science Foundation of China (62173007, 61903009, and 62006008), and Beijing Excellent Talent Training Support Project for Young Top-Notch Team (2018000026833TD01).",,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,"Algorithms; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Neurons; Time Factors",2022-02-27,2022,2022-02-27,2022-02-27,2022,,3672905,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liu, Wenjie; Bai, Yuting; Jin, Xuebo; Wang, Xiaoyi; Su, Tingli; Kong, Jianlei","Liu, Wenjie (School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; Beijing Laboratory for Intelligent Environmental Protection, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Food Chain Pollution Control, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn); Bai, Yuting (School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; Beijing Laboratory for Intelligent Environmental Protection, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Food Chain Pollution Control, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn); Jin, Xuebo (School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; Beijing Laboratory for Intelligent Environmental Protection, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Food Chain Pollution Control, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn); Wang, Xiaoyi (School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; Beijing Laboratory for Intelligent Environmental Protection, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Food Chain Pollution Control, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn); Su, Tingli (School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; Beijing Laboratory for Intelligent Environmental Protection, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Food Chain Pollution Control, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn); Kong, Jianlei (School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; Beijing Laboratory for Intelligent Environmental Protection, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Food Chain Pollution Control, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China, btbu.edu.cn)","Bai, Yuting (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University); Jin, Xuebo (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University)","Liu, Wenjie (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University); Bai, Yuting (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University); Jin, Xuebo (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University); Wang, Xiaoyi (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University); Su, Tingli (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University); Kong, Jianlei (Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University; Beijing Technology and Business University)",2,2,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/3672905.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145879100,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

Therefore, modeling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water pollution. In this work, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm, have been developed. In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes, have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7 significant parameters, and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction. Furthermore, the NARNET and LSTM models have achieved similar accuracy for the testing phase with a slight difference in the regression coefficient (RNARNET = 96.17% and RLSTM = 94.21%). This kind of promising research can contribute significantly to water management.","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research &amp; Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this research work through the project number IFT20111.",,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,,,2020-12-29,2020,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,2020,,6659314,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aldhyani, Theyazn H.

In this study, a developed time series forecasting model is proposed for oil production using a new improved version of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This model is improved by using an optimization algorithm, the slime mould algorithm (SMA). The SMA is a new algorithm that is applied for solving different optimization tasks. However, its search mechanism suffers from some limitations, for example, trapping at local optima. Thus, we modify the SMA using an intelligence search technique called opposition-based learning (OLB). The developed model, ANFIS-SMAOLB, is evaluated with different real-world oil production data collected from two oilfields in two different countries, Masila oilfield (Yemen) and Tahe oilfield (China). Furthermore, the evaluation of this model is considered with extensive comparisons to several methods, using several evaluation measures.

The infiltration line is an important core index of tailings pond stability. In this paper, a tailings pond monitoring and early warning system, which provides technical support for the design and daily management of tailings reservoir early warning systems, is constructed. Based on a deep learning bidirectional recurrent long and short memory network, an infiltration line prediction model with univariate input and an infiltration line prediction model with multivariate input are proposed.

Developed models include Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), and four hybrid forms of GMDH and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in combination with Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO) and Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) algorithms. The number of 160 datasets that were applied to assess these models was extracted from the Janssen (PhD’s Thesis, Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering. University of California, 1999) experimental study. Input parameters to predict Qs included the water level in the reservoir (hw), bed level in the flushing channel (hb), outflow (Qout), inflow (Qin), and elapsed time of flushing (T). The performance of all models was evaluated by four statistical indices of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R2), and Mean absolute relative error (MARE). Evaluation of results demonstrated that the HGSO and EO algorithms could enhance the accuracy of the GMDH model (up to 26% and 22% in terms of RMSE), respectively. According to statistical criteria, the SVR-EO and SVR-HGSO provided the highest accuracy in both training (R2 = 0.98) and validation phases (R2 = 0.96). Moreover, among the developed models, the GMDH-HGSO algorithm provided excellent fitness to the observed data (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 22.37, MAE = 15.65, and MARE = 0.26). The results indicated the high efficiency of the HGSO and EO algorithms in improving the accuracy of the GMDH and SVR models. However, among the developed models, the GMDH-HGSO is the most accurate model and is recommended for sediment transport modelling.",,,Scientific Reports,,"Neural Networks, Computer; Machine Learning; Linear Models; Algorithms; Water",2022-11-12,2022,2022-11-12,,12,1,19390,All OA; Gold,Article,"Javadi, Fahime; Qaderi, Kourosh; Ahmadi, Mohammad Mehdi; Rahimpour, Majid; Madadi, Mohamad Reza; Mahdavi-Meymand, Amin","Javadi, Fahime (Department of Water Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran); Qaderi, Kourosh (Department of Water Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran); Ahmadi, Mohammad Mehdi (Department of Water Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran); Rahimpour, Majid (Department of Water Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran); Madadi, Mohamad Reza (Department of Water Engineering, University of Jiroft, Jiroft, Iran); Mahdavi-Meymand, Amin (Institute of Hydro-Engineering, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland)","Javadi, Fahime (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman)","Javadi, Fahime (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman); Qaderi, Kourosh (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman); Ahmadi, Mohammad Mehdi (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman); Rahimpour, Majid (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman); Madadi, Mohamad Reza (University of Jiroft); Mahdavi-Meymand, Amin (Polish Academy of Sciences)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23781-x.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152701277,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

Conventionally, Poisson’s ratio estimation requires either laboratory experiments or derived from sonic logs, the main concerns of these methods are the data and samples availability, costs, and time-consumption. In this paper, an alternative real-time technique utilizing drilling parameters and machine learning was presented. The main added value of this approach is that the drilling parameters are more likely to be available and could be collected in real-time during drilling operation without additional cost. These parameters include weight on bit, penetration rate, pump rate, standpipe pressure, and torque. Two machine learning algorithms were used, artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). To train and test the models, 2905 data points from one well were used, while 2912 data points from a different well were used for model validation. The lithology of both wells contains carbonate, sandstone, and shale. Optimization on different tuning parameters in the algorithm was conducted to ensure the best prediction was achieved. A good match between the actual and predicted Poisson’s ratio was achieved in both methods with correlation coefficients between 0.98 and 0.99 using ANN and between 0.97 and 0.98 using ANFIS. The average absolute percentage error values were between 1 and 2% in ANN predictions and around 2% when ANFIS was used. Based on these results, the employment of drilling data and machine learning is a strong tool for real-time prediction of geomechanical properties without additional cost.",,,Scientific Reports,,,2021-06-15,2021,2021-06-15,,11,1,12611,All OA; Gold,Article,"Siddig, Osama; Gamal, Hany; Elkatatny, Salaheldin; Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez","Siddig, Osama (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Box 5049, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Gamal, Hany (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Box 5049, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Box 5049, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; Petroleum Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Box 5049, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; Cairo University)","Siddig, Osama (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Gamal, Hany (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; Cairo University); Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",13,13,0.84,6.95,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92082-6.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138867244,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Selecting the most efficient development plan is of high interest to optimize economic cost. Hence, the main objective of this study is to construct a novel deep-learning classifier to select the best EOR method based on the reservoir’s rock and fluid properties (depth, porosity, permeability, gravity, viscosity), and temperature. Our deep learning-based classifier consists of a one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and densely connected neural network layers. The genetic algorithm has been applied to tune the hyperparameters of this hybrid classifier. The proposed classifier is developed and tested using 735 EOR projects on sandstone, unconsolidated sandstone, carbonate, and conglomerate reservoirs in more than 17 countries. Both the numerical and graphical investigations approve that the structure-tuned deep learning classifier is a reliable tool to screen the EOR scenarios and select the best one. The designed model correctly classifies training, validation, and testing examples with an accuracy of 96.82%, 84.31%, and 82.61%, respectively. It means that only 30 out of 735 available EOR projects are incorrectly identified by the proposed deep learning classifier. The model also demonstrates a small categorical cross-entropy of 0.1548 for the classification of the involved enhanced oil recovery techniques. Such a powerful classifier is required to select the most suitable EOR candidate for a given oil reservoir with limited field information.",,,Scientific Reports,,,2023-03-25,2023,2023-03-25,,13,1,4892,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kumar Pandey, Rakesh; Gandomkar, Asghar; Vaferi, Behzad; Kumar, Anil; Torabi, Farshid","Kumar Pandey, Rakesh (Department of Petroleum and Energy Studies, School of Engineering and Technology, DIT University, Dehradun, India); Gandomkar, Asghar (Department of Chemical Engineering, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran); Vaferi, Behzad (Department of Chemical Engineering, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Advanced Calculations, Chemical, Petroleum, and Polymer Engineering Research Center, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran); Kumar, Anil (Director, Tula’s Institute, 248001, Dehradun, India); Torabi, Farshid (Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Regina, S4S 0A2, Regina, SK, Canada)","Vaferi, Behzad (Islamic Azad University of Shiraz; Islamic Azad University of Shiraz)","Kumar Pandey, Rakesh (Dehradun Institute of Technology University); Gandomkar, Asghar (Islamic Azad University of Shiraz); Vaferi, Behzad (Islamic Azad University of Shiraz; Islamic Azad University of Shiraz); Kumar, Anil (); Torabi, Farshid (University of Regina)",3,3,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32187-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156493210,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

The oil industry has been following the path of several other industrial sectors and has implemented digitalization to solve different challenges and problems. The present work, supported by extensive research carried out in the specialized literature, shows relevant applications of digital transformation to solve problems in drilling and production operations during the life cycle of an oil well. The main issues addressed in the research were stuck pipes and hydrate formation. The achievements show that control systems and the various sensors used during drilling and the useful life of an oil well generate data that creates opportunities for the use of computational and artificial intelligence techniques. New technologies associated with digital transformation include smart surveillance systems, real-time monitoring, and intelligent equipment. In a well oil environment, these novelties are associated with fault detection and prediction systems to avoid or reduce problems or accidents that may cause costs or, in extreme cases, lead to the loss of the well. The study also points out that the oil industries, research centers, and universities are increasingly working together to understand the challenges and overcome the problems associated with the implementation and greater use of digital transformation technologies.",,The research was supported by Petrobras—Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. through the R&D Project no. 21354-6.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data.
RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine.
CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for studies on AI.",,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2,2020-12-15,2020,2020-12-15,,22,12,e20756,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alajlani, Mohannad; Alhuwail, Dari; Schneider, Jens; Al-Kuwari, Saif; Shah, Zubair; Hamdi, Mounir; Househ, Mowafa","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa (Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar); Alajlani, Mohannad (Institute of Digital Healthcare, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom); Alhuwail, Dari (Information Science Department, College of Life Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait, Kuwait); Schneider, Jens (Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar); Al-Kuwari, Saif (Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar); Shah, Zubair (Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar); Hamdi, Mounir (Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar); Househ, Mowafa (Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar)","Househ, Mowafa (Qatar Foundation)","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa (Qatar Foundation); Alajlani, Mohannad (University of Warwick); Alhuwail, Dari (Kuwait University); Schneider, Jens (Qatar Foundation); Al-Kuwari, Saif (Qatar Foundation); Shah, Zubair (Qatar Foundation); Hamdi, Mounir (Qatar Foundation); Househ, Mowafa (Qatar Foundation)",57,56,4.14,27.43,https://www.jmir.org/2020/12/e20756/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129741626,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Water primarily becomes polluted due to organic as well as inorganic pollutants, including nutrients, heavy metals, and constant contamination with organic materials. Predicting the quality of water accurately is essential for its better management along with controlling pollution. With stricter laws regarding water treatment to remove organic and biologic materials along with different pollutants, looking for novel technologic procedures will be necessary for improved control of the treatment processes by water utilities. Linear regression-based models with relative simplicity considering water prediction have been typically used as available statistical models. Nevertheless, in a majority of real problems, particularly those associated with modeling of water quality, non-linear patterns will be observed, requiring non-linear models to address them. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) can be a good candidate in modeling and optimizing the elimination of pollutants from water in empirical settings with the ability to generate ideal operational variables, due to its recent considerable advancements. Management and operation of water treatment procedures are supported technically by these technologies, leading to higher efficiency compared to sole dependence on human operations. Thus, establishing predictive models for water quality and subsequently, more efficient management of water resources would be critically important, serving as a strong tool. A systematic review methodology has been employed in the present work to investigate the previous studies over the time interval of 2010–2020, while analyzing and synthesizing the literature, particularly regarding AI application in water treatment.

The hydrodynamic field controls the content of various ions in formation water and is an important participant in hydrocarbon evolution. One potential high-yield gas field is the tight sandstone gas reservoirs in the northern Tianhuan Depression of the Ordos Basin, China. However, due to the complex gas-water relationship and limited water sample data, the development of gas reservoirs has encountered great difficulties; we thus analyzed the geochemical characteristics of a large scale of formation water acquired from the Permian in the Ordos Basin (60 water samples collected from 45 wells in the He8 Member). The results showed that formation water is the original sedimentary water in tight sandstone reservoirs, which represent a closed hydrological environment, which is conducive to gas accumulation. This is also related to the demonstrated strong water-rock reaction and diagenetic. We also developed a statistical model between these geochemical parameters and gas preservation based on machine learning algorithms (decision trees). Note that machine learning, as a data-driven artificial intelligence algorithm, generates massive correlation models that can learn from the structured training data sets to carry out predictions or evaluations in newly presented data. This algorithm can process large amounts of information data more quickly and can build more perfect correlation models through deep learning mechanisms than traditional statistical methods. The results suggest that the metamorphism coefficient has the best indication effect on the preservation of gas reservoirs. The hydrological environment with (Cl--Na+)/Mg2+ > 50.066, Na+/Cl- ≤ 0.476, and Ma2+/Ca2+ ≤ 0.102 is a good hydrocarbon accumulation area. This study can be applied, by analogy, to more comprehensively interpret the correlation between the geochemical characteristics of formation water and hydrocarbon storage and to improve the accuracy of predicting favorable hydrocarbon accumulation areas in tight sandstone gas reservoirs.",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41872102; 41202107).

Numerous available equations can be used to calculate S w, but their values have been unreliable and strongly depend on core analyses, which are costly and time-consuming. Hence, this study implements artificial intelligence (AI) modules to predict S w from the conventional well logs. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to estimate S w using gamma-ray (GR) log, neutron porosity (NPHI) log, and resistivity (R t) log. A data set of 782 points from two wells (Well-1 and Well-2) in tight gas sandstone formation was used to develop and test the different AI modules. Well-1 was used to construct the AI models, then the hidden data set from Well-2 was applied to validate the optimized models. The results showed that the ANN and ANFIS models were able to accurately estimate S w from the conventional well logging data. The correlation coefficient (R) values between the actual and estimated S w from the ANN model were found to be 0.93 and 0.91 compared to 0.95 and 0.90 for the ANFIS model during the training and testing processes. The average absolute percentage error (AAPE) was less than 5% in both models. A new empirical correlation was established using the biases and weights from the developed ANN model. The correlation was validated with the unseen data set from Well-2, and the correlation coefficient between the actual and the estimated S w was 0.91 with an AAPE of 6%. This study provides AI application with an empirical correlation to estimate the water saturation from the readily available conventional logging data without the requirement for experimental analysis or well site interventions.",The authors wish to acknowledge King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals for permitting the publication of this work.,,ACS Omega,,,2022-01-03,2022,2022-01-03,2022-01-11,7,1,215-222,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid; Elkatatny, Salaheldin; Ramadan, Mustafa Al","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (Department of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia; Center for Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia; Center for Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Ramadan, Mustafa Al (Department of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia; Center for Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Ramadan, Mustafa Al (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",5,5,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c04416,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144369598,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Time and money could be saved if the compressive strength of concrete is accurately measured. In this study, two machine learning models, namely, boosted decision tree regression (BDTR) and support vector machine (SVM), were developed to predict concrete compressive strength (CCS) using a complete dataset through the previous scientific studies. Eight concrete mixture parameters were used as the input dataset. Four statistical indices, namely the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE-Standard Deviation Ratio (RSR), were used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed models. The results show that the BDTR model outperformed SVM model with the overall result of R2=0.86 and RMSE=6.19 and MAE=4.91 and RSR=0.37, respectively.

When modeling heterogeneous, geologically realistic discrete model spaces, such as categorical fields, Monte Carlo methods are needed to properly sample the solution space. Inversion algorithms use a forward operator, such as a numerical groundwater solver. The forward operator often represents the bottleneck for the high computational cost of the Monte Carlo sampling schemes. Even if efficient sampling methods (for example Posterior Population Expansion, PoPEx) have been developed, they need significant computing resources. It is therefore desirable to speed up such methods. As only a few models generated by the sampler have a significant likelihood, we propose to predict the significance of generated models by means of machine learning. Only models labeled as significant are passed to the forward solver, otherwise, they are rejected. This work compares the performance of AdaBoost, Random Forest, and convolutional neural network as classifiers integrated with the PoPEx framework. During initial iterations of the algorithm, the forward solver is always executed and subsurface models along with the likelihoods are stored. Then, the machine learning schemes are trained on the available data. We demonstrate the technique using a simulation of a tracer test in a fluvial aquifer. The geology is modeled by the multiple-point statistical approach, the field contains four geological facies, with associated permeability, porosity, and specific storage values. MODFLOW is used for groundwater flow and transport simulation. The solution of the inverse problem is used to estimate the 10 days protection zone around the pumping well. The estimated speed-ups with Random Forest and AdaBoost were higher than with the convolutional neural network. To validate the approach, computing times of inversion without and with machine learning schemes were computed and the error against the reference solution was calculated. For the same mean error, accelerated PoPEx achieved a speed-up rate of up to 2 with respect to the standard PoPEx.","The authors are grateful to the numerous discussions and help received on this project from Christoph Jaggli who was involved in the first initial tests of that approach, Yasin Dagasan who supported the implementation of some early versions of the ML schemes and Julien Straubhaar for the MPS simulations using DeeSse.

Therefore, this study aims to develop a reliable prediction model to predict D.O. in the Fei-Tsui reservoir for better water quality monitoring. The proposed model is an artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer. Twenty-nine years of water quality data have been used to validate the accuracy of the proposed model. A different number of neurons have been investigated to optimize the model's accuracy. Statistical indices have been used to examine the reliability of the model. In addition to that, sensitivity analysis has been carried out to investigate the model's sensitivity to the input parameters. The results revealed the proposed model capable of capturing the dissolved oxygen's nonlinearity with an acceptable level of accuracy where the R-squared value was equal to 0.98. The optimum number of neurons was found to be equal to 15-neuron. Sensitivity analysis shows that the model can predict D.O. where four input parameters have been included as input where the d-factor value was equal to 0.010. This main achievement and finding will significantly impact the water quality status in reservoirs. Having such a simple and accurate model embedded in IoT devices to monitor and predict water quality parameters in real-time would ease the decision-makers and managers to control the pollution risk and support their decisions to improve water quality in reservoirs.","The authors would like to appreciate the open access publication payment supported by the School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia.

Large-scale national rivers are maintained through systematic maintenance and management, whereas many difficulties can be encountered in the management of small-scale local rivers. Damage to embankments due to illegal farming along rivers has resulted in collapses during torrential rainfall. Various fertilizers and pesticides are applied along embankments, resulting in pollution of water and ecological spaces. Controlling such activities along riversides is challenging given the inconvenience of checking sites individually, the difficulty in checking the ease of site access, and the need to check a wide area. Furthermore, considerable time and effort is required for site investigation. Addressing such problems would require rapidly obtaining precise land data to understand the field status. This study aimed to monitor time series data by applying artificial intelligence technology that can read the cultivation status using drone-based images. With these images, the cultivated area along the river was annotated, and data were trained using the YOLOv5 and DeepLabv3+ algorithms. The performance index mAP@0.5 was used, targeting >85%. Both algorithms satisfied the target, confirming that the status of cultivated land along a river can be read using drone-based time series images.",We would like to express our gratitude to Asan City for supporting the access to the research target areas and for the drone-based filming.,"This study used datasets from the machine learning data collection projects funded by the Ministry of Science & ICT and National Information Society Agency (NIA, S.

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have previously proved to be accurate tools for DO concentration prediction. This study presents the implementation of a deep learning approach applied to a recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm. The proposed deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) model is compared with support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models, formerly shown to be robust AI algorithms. The Fanno Creek in Oregon (USA) is selected as a case study and daily values of water temperature, specific conductance, streamflow discharge, pH, and DO concentration are used as input variables to predict DO concentration for three different lead times (“t + 1,” “t + 3,” and “t + 7”). Based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient, several input variable combinations are formed and used for prediction. The model prediction performance is evaluated using various indices such as correlation coefficient, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error, and mean absolute error.

Evaporation is an intricate nonlinear process occurring as a result of several climatic aspects. The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility of using Random Forest (RF) and two deep learning techniques, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), and deep neural network (DNN) to accurately estimate monthly pan evaporation rates. Month-based weather data gathered from four Malaysian weather stations during the 2000–2019 timeframe was used to train and evaluate the models. Several input attributes (predictor variables) were investigated to select the most suitable variables for machine learning models. Every approach was tested with several models, each with a different set of model aspects and input parameter combinations. The formulated ML approaches were benchmarked against two commonly used empirical methods: Stephens & Stewart and Thornthwaite. Model outcomes were assessed using standard statistical measures to determine their effectiveness in predicting evaporation. The results indicated that the three ML models developed in the study performed better than empirical models and could significantly improve the precision of monthly Ep estimates even with the identical input sets. The performance assessment metrics also show that the formulated CNN approach was acceptable for modelling monthly water loss due to evaporation with a higher degree of accuracy than other ML frameworks explored in this study. In addition, the CNN framework outperformed other AI techniques evaluated for the same areas using identical data inputs. The investigation’s findings in relation to the various performance criteria show that the proposed CNN model is capable of capturing the highly non-linearity of evaporation and could be regarded as an effective tool to predict evaporation.","The author would like to thank the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship (RTP) for its support.

The P b can be measured from the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) experiments. Nonetheless, the PVT measurements have limitations, such as being costly and time-consuming. Therefore, some studies used alternative methods, namely, empirical correlations and machine learning techniques, to obtain the P b. However, the previously published methods have restrictions like accuracy, and some use specific data to build their models. In addition, most of the previously published models have not shown the proper relationships between the features and targets to indicate the correct physical behavior. Therefore, this study develops an accurate and robust correlation to obtain the P b applying the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). The GMDH combines neural networks and statistical methods that generate relationships among the feature and target parameters. A total of 760 global datasets were used to develop the GMDH model. The GMDH model is verified using trend analysis and indicates that the GMDH model follows all input parameters' exact physical behavior. In addition, different statistical analyses were conducted to investigate the GMDH and the published models' robustness. The GMDH model follows the correct trend for four input parameters (gas solubility, gas specific gravity, oil specific gravity, and reservoir temperature). The GMDH correlation has the lowest average percent relative error, root mean square error, and standard deviation of 8.51%, 12.70, and 0.09, respectively, and the highest correlation coefficient of 0.9883 compared to published models.

Through the gradual transformation of interconnected computing blocks into continuous computing tissue, the development of advanced forms of matter exhibiting basic features of intelligence can be envisioned, able to learn and process information in a delocalized manner. Such intelligent matter would interact with the environment by receiving and responding to external stimuli, while internally adapting its structure to enable the distribution and storage (as memory) of information.

Researchers have applied multiple artificial intelligence based techniques to predict earthquakes, but high accuracies could not be achieved due to the huge size of multidimensional data, communication delays, transmission latency, limited processing capacity and data privacy issues. Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) technique that provides an opportunity to collect and process data onsite without compromising on data privacy and preventing data transmission to the central server. The federated concept of obtaining a global data model by aggregation of local data models inherently ensures data security, data privacy, and data heterogeneity. In this article, a novel earthquake prediction framework using FL has been proposed. The proposed FL framework has given better performance over already developed ML based earthquake predicting models in terms of efficiency, reliability, and precision. We have analyzed three different local datasets to generate multiple ML based local data models. These local data models have been aggregated to generate global data model on the central FL server using FedQuake algorithm. Meta classifier has been trained at the FL server on global data model to generate more accurate earthquake predictions. We have tested the proposed framework by analyzing multidimensional seismic data within 100 km radial area from 34.708° N, 72.5478° E in Western Himalayas. The results of the proposed framework have been validated against instrumentally recorded regional seismic data of last thirty-five years, and 88.87% prediction accuracy has been recorded.

A reasonable amount of EWR requires a systematic understanding of the relationship among the surface water, groundwater, ecology and economy. However, studying surface water-groundwater interactions still remains an important issue. Thus, a coupled model integrating a Muskingum method-based open channel flow model and machine learning-based groundwater model is developed to describe the dynamic changes in streamflow and groundwater level in response to the EWR of Yongding River. The model is calibrated using observed streamflow data as well as groundwater level data on a daily scale for the spring EWR in 2020. The simulated results match well with the observed data and suggest that significant groundwater level increases occur only around the main channel of Yongding River. Fifteen scenarios under different EWR schemes are set to obtain reasonable streamflow during EWR, and then the responses of streamflow and groundwater level changes are simulated. Reasonable streamflow at the Guanting Reservoir need to be above 65 m3/s to ensure the streamflow can pass through Beijing and significant groundwater level recoveries of 170 million m3 through EWR. The developed models can improve the understanding of the interaction between surface water and groundwater and provide a quick assessment of the factors influencing the different EWR schemes and thus aid in effective EWR project management.","This work was supported by Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project (Grant No: Z191100006919001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41877173 and 41831283), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC0407900) and the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment of China (2018ZX07101005-04).

The reservoir of the ESN is composed of a large number of sparsely connected neurons with randomly generated weight matrices. How to set the structural parameters of the ESN becomes a difficult problem in practical applications. Traditionally, the design of the parameters of the ESN structure is performed manually. The manual adjustment of the ESN parameters is not convenient since it is an extremely challenging and time-consuming task. This paper proposes an ensemble of five particle swarm optimization (PSO) strategies to design the structure of ESN and then reduce the manual intervention in the design process. An adaptive selection mechanism is used for each particle in the evolution to select a strategy from the strategy candidate pool for evolution. In addition, leaky integration neurons are used as reservoir internal neurons, which are added within the adaptive mechanism for optimization. The root mean squared error (RMSE) is adopted as the evaluation criterion. The experimental results on Mackey-Glass time series benchmark dataset show that the proposed method outperforms other traditional evolutionary methods. Furthermore, experimental results on electrocardiogram dataset show that the proposed method on the ensemble of PSO displays an excellent performance on real-world problems.",,,International Journal of Neural Systems,,"Neural Networks, Computer; Neurons; Time Factors",2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,2021-12,31,12,2150057,All OA; Green,Article,"Xue, Yu; Zhang, Qi; Neri, Ferrante","Xue, Yu (School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, P.

The industry is known for its lack of dynamic control across complex integrated systems running deep underground, making IoT technologies difficult to implement. An important integrated system in a typical underground mine is the refrigeration-ventilation system. In practice, the two systems are still controlled independently, often due to a lack of continuous measurements. However, their integrated effects ultimately affect energy usage and production. This study develops and compares various machine learning prediction techniques to predict the integrated behavior of a key component operating on the boundary of the refrigeration-ventilation system, while also addressing the lack of continuous measurements. The component lacks sensors and the developed industrial machine learning models negate the effect thereof using integrated control. The predictive models are compared based on accuracy, prediction time, as well as the amount of data required to obtain the required level of accuracy. The ""Support Vector Machines"" method achieved the lowest average error (1.97%), but the ""Artificial Neural Network"" method is more robust (with a maximum percentage error of 12.90%). A potential energy saving of 215 kW or 2.9% of the ventilation and refrigeration system, equivalent to R1.33-million per annum ($82 900) is achievable using the ""Support Vector Machines"" method.",,"The work was sponsored by Integrated Post Graduate Industry Partnership (IPGIP) NPC, South Africa.

Therefore, characterization of carbonate rocks using petrophysical data is a challenging task. Conventional neutron, sonic, and neutron-density porosities are proven to be less accurate as compared to the NMR porosity. This study aims to predict the NMR porosity by implementing three different machine learning (ML) algorithms using conventional well logs including neutron-porosity, sonic, resistivity, gamma ray, and photoelectric factor. Data, comprising 3500 data points, was acquired from a vast carbonate petroleum reservoir in the Middle East. The input parameters were selected based on their relative importance with respect to output parameter. Three ML techniques such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN), and functional network (FN) were implemented for the development of prediction models. The model’s accuracy was evaluated by correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and average absolute percentage error (AAPE). The results demonstrated that all three prediction models are reliable and consistent exhibiting low errors and high ‘R’ values for both training and testing prediction when related to actual dataset. However, the performance of ANN model was better as compared to other two studied ML techniques based on minimum AAPE and RMSE errors (5.12 and 0.39) and highest R (0.95) for testing and validation outcome. The AAPE and RMSE for the testing and validation results were found to be 5.38 and 0.41 for ANFIS and 6.06 and 0.48 for FN model, respectively. The ANFIS and FN models exhibited ‘R’ 0.937 and 0.942, for testing and validation dataset, respectively. Based on testing and validation results, ANFIS and FN models have been ranked second and third after ANN. Further, optimized ANN and FN models were used to extract explicit correlations to compute the NMR porosity. Hence, this study reveals the successful applications of ML techniques for the accurate prediction of NMR porosity.",,,Scientific Reports,,,2023-03-09,2023,2023-03-09,,13,1,3956,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mustafa, Ayyaz; Tariq, Zeeshan; Mahmoud, Mohamed; Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez","Mustafa, Ayyaz (Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 15260, Pittsburgh, PA, USA); Tariq, Zeeshan (Physical Science and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), 23955, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia); Mahmoud, Mohamed (Petroleum Engineering Department, College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez (Petroleum Engineering Department, College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia)","Mustafa, Ayyaz (University of Pittsburgh)","Mustafa, Ayyaz (University of Pittsburgh); Tariq, Zeeshan (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology); Mahmoud, Mohamed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30708-7.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156062662,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 51 Physical Sciences,

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses computers to learn patterns in data and has many healthcare applications, such as an aid in diagnosis, personalized medicine, and clinical decision support. Yet, how machine learning models make decisions is often opaque. The spirit of explainable artificial intelligence is to use machine learning models that produce interpretable solutions. Here, we use topic modeling to synthesize recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence approaches to extracting domain knowledge from machine learning models relevant to deep brain stimulation. The results show that patient classification (i.e., diagnostic models, precision medicine) is the most common problem in deep brain stimulation studies that employ explainable artificial intelligence.

The simulated well-test pressure derivatives with varying noise percentages comprise the training samples. The feature selection and hyperparameter tuning have been performed carefully using the genetic algorithm to enhance the prediction accuracy. The models were validated using nine simulated and one real-field test case. The optimized classifier identifies all the reservoir models with a classification accuracy higher than 79%. In addition, the statistical analysis approves that the optimized regressors accurately perform the reservoir characterization with mean relative errors of lower than 4.5%.

Characterisation of processes such as drug dissolution and precipitation is vital in quality control testing and drug manufacture. To support existing techniques like in vitro dissolution testing, novel process analytical technologies (PATs) can give an insight into these processes. The aim of this study was to create and explore the potential of an automated image classification model based on image analysis to identify events (dissolution and precipitation) occurring in the flow-through apparatus (FTA) test cell, and the ability to characterise a dissolution process over time. Several precipitation conditions were tested in a USP 4 FTA test cell with images recorded during early (plume formation) and late (particulate re-formation) stages of precipitation. An available MATLAB code was used as a base to develop and validate an anomaly classification model able to detect different events occurring during the precipitation process in the dissolution cell. Two variants of the model were tested on images from a dissolution test in the FTA, with a view to application of the image analysis system to quantitative characterization of the dissolution process over time. It was found that the classification model is highly accurate (> 90%) in detecting events occurring in the FTA test cell. The model showed potential to be used to characterise the stages of dissolution and precipitation processes, and as a proof of concept demonstrates potential for deep machine learning image analysis to be applied to kinetics of other pharmaceutical processes.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

It can enhance the quality of decisions taken and the economics of drilling operations. The pressure while drilling tool can be used to provide pressure data while drilling, but the tool cost and its availability limit its usage in many wells. The available models in the literature for pressure gradient prediction are based on well logging or a combination of some drilling parameters and well logging. The well-logging data are not available for all wells in all sections in most wells. The objective of this paper is to use support vector machines, functional networks, and random forest (RF) to develop three models for real-time pore pressure gradient prediction using both mechanical and hydraulic drilling parameters. The used parameters are mud flow rate (Q), standpipe pressure, rate of penetration, and rotary speed (RS). A data set of 3239 field data points was used to develop the predictive models. A different data set unseen by the model was utilized for the validation of the proposed models. The three models predicted the pore pressure gradient with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.99 and 0.97 for training and testing, respectively. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) ranged from 0.008 to 0.021 psi/ft for training and testing, respectively, between the predicted and the actual pore pressure data. Moreover, the average absolute percentage error (AAPE) ranged from 0.97% to 3.07% for training and testing, respectively. The RF model outperformed the other models by an R of 0.99 and RMSE of 0.01. The developed models were validated using another data set. The models predicted the pore pressure gradient for the validation data set with high accuracy (R of 0.99, RMSE around 0.01, and AAPE around 1.8%).

In this study, Tangjiao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) in China was taken as a case study. Three groundwater level monitoring sensors were installed in different locations of the landslide. The monitoring data indicated that the fluctuation of groundwater level is significantly consistent with rainfall and reservoir level in time, but there is a lag. In addition, there is a spatial difference in the impact of reservoir levels on the landslide groundwater level. The data of two monitoring locations were selected for establishing the prediction model of groundwater. Combined with the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the influencing factors were selected, respectively, to establish the hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) prediction model. The single-factor GA-SVM without considering influencing factors and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model were adopted to make comparisons. The results showed that the multi-factor GA-SVM performed the best, followed by multi-factor BPNN and single-factor GA-SVM. We found that the prediction accuracy can be improved by considering the influencing factor. The proposed GA-SVM model combines the advantages of each algorithm; it can effectively construct the response relationship between groundwater level fluctuations and influencing factors. Above all, the multi-factor GA-SVM is an effective method for the prediction of landslides groundwater in the TGRA.",We greatly appreciate the careful reviews and thoughtful suggestions by reviewers.

The rational use of reservoir operation scheme can not only enhance the capacity of flood control and disaster reduction in the basin, but also improve the efficiency of water use and give full play to the comprehensive role the reservoir. The conventional decision-making method of reservoir operation scheme is computationally large, subjectivity and difficult to capture the nonlinear relationship. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a reservoir operation scheme decision-making model IWGAN-IWOA-CNN based on artificial intelligence and deep learning technology. In view of the lack of data in the original reservoir operation scheme and the limited improvement of data characteristics by the traditional data augmentation algorithm, an improved generative adversarial network algorithm (IWGAN) is proposed. IWGAN uses the loss function which integrates Wasserstein distance, gradient penalty and difference item, and dynamically adds random noise in the process of model training. The whale optimization algorithm is improved by introducing Logistic chaotic mapping to initialize population, non-linear convergence factor and adaptive weights, and Levy flight perturbation strategy. The improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) is used to optimize hyperparameters of convolutional neural networks (CNN), so as to obtain the best parameters for model prediction.

Machine Learning (ML) models have become accurate and powerful tools in predicting pan evaporation. Meanwhile, the ""black-box"" character and the consistency with the physical process can decrease the practical implication of ML models. To overcome such limitations, we attempt to develop an interpretable based-ML framework to predict daily pan evaporation using Extra Tree, XGBoost, SVR, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) ML models using hourly climate datasets. To that end, we integrated and employed the Shapely Additive explanations (SHAP), Sobol-based sensitivity analysis, and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to evaluate the interpretability of the models in predicting daily pan evaporation, at Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah (SMBA) weather station, in Morocco. The validation results of the models showed that the developed models are accurate in reproducing the daily pan evaporation with NSE ranging from 0.76 to 0.83 during the validation phase. Furthermore, the interpretability results of the ML models showed that the air temperature (Ta), solar radiation (Rs), followed by relative humidity (H) are the most important climate variables with inflection points of the Ta_median, Ta_mean, Rs_sum, H_mean, and w_std are 17.42 °C, 17.65 °C, 3.8 kw.m-2, 69.59%, and 1.25 m s-1, sequentially. Overall, the interpretability of the models showed a good consistency of the ML models with the real hydro-climatic process of evaporation in a semi-arid environment. Hence, the proposed methodology is powerful in enhancing the reliability and transparency of the developed models for predicting daily pan evaporation. Finally, the proposed approach is new insights to reduce the ''Black-Box'' character of ML models in hydrological studies.","The authors thank the river basin agency of Bouregreg and Chaouia for its support and help during data collection.

In our LSTM model, in the learning phase from July 2003 to March 2018, three input data items consisting of the daily precipitation (DP), the daily average temperature (DAT), and the accumulated amount of landfilled waste presented the quantity of leachate generated with high accuracy. The DAT was important for the landfill site, particularly in a snow area because it contributes to the leachate generated during the spring thaw with low precipitation. In the testing phase from April 2018 to March 2019, our LSTM model predicted the leachate generated with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 26.2%. The concentrations of biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, calcium ion and chloride ion in leachate were presented in the learning phase by six input data items: DP, DAT, and the daily amount of landfilled waste (incineration residue, incombustible waste, business waste, and combustible waste) with high R2 values. In the testing phase, the quality of leachate was predicted with the MAPE between 11.8% and 30.2%. Another year data from April 2019 to March 2020 was used to verify accuracy of our model with no overfitting. This study showed the possibility of applying the LSTM model to future predictions of leachate quantity and quality from landfill sites with an acceptable error for daily operation.","We thank the municipality that cooperated with our research.

Although bacterial resistance appeared before any human life form, this process has accelerated in the past years. Important causes of AR in modern times could be the over-prescription of antibiotics, the presence of faulty infection-prevention strategies, pollution in overcrowded areas, or the use of antibiotics in agriculture and farming, together with a decreased interest from the pharmaceutical industry in researching and testing new antibiotics. The last cause is primarily due to the high costs of developing antibiotics. The aim of the present review is to highlight the techniques that are being developed for the identification of new antibiotics to assist this lengthy process, using artificial intelligence (AI). AI can shorten the preclinical phase by rapidly generating many substances based on algorithms created by machine learning (ML) through techniques such as neural networks (NN) or deep learning (DL). Recently, a text mining system that incorporates DL algorithms was used to help and speed up the data curation process. Moreover, new and old methods are being used to identify new antibiotics, such as the combination of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods with ML or Raman spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS combined with NN, offering faster and easier interpretation of results.

This scenario poses tremendous challenges for detection and identification of signals of varying shape and quality at the edge of the signal-to-noise limit. Here, we demonstrate a robust target identification scheme that utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for multiplex detection of single particles and molecular biomarkers. The model combines fast wavelet particle detection with Short-Time Fourier Transform analysis, followed by DNN identification on an AI-specific edge device (Google Coral Dev board). The approach is validated using multi-spot optical excitation of Klebsiella Pneumoniae bacterial nucleic acids flowing through an optofluidic waveguide chip that produces fluorescence signals of varying amplitude, duration, and quality. Amplification-free 3× multiplexing in real-time is demonstrated with excellent specificity, sensitivity, and a classification accuracy of 99.8%.

Such a new approach provides an opportunity to generate real-time data from water with the noncontact method, largely improving working efficiency. By summarizing the development and current applications of hyperspectral remote sensing, we compare the relative merits of varying remote sensing platforms, popular inversion models, and the application of hyperspectral monitoring of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), transparency, total suspended solids (TSS), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), phycocyanin (PC), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) water quality parameters. Most studies have focused on spaceborne remote sensing, which is usually used to monitor large waterbodies for Chl-a and other water quality parameters with optical properties; semiempirical, bio-optical, and semianalytical models are frequently used. With the rapid development of aerospace technology and near-surface remote sensing, the spectral resolution of remote sensing imaging technology has been dramatically improved and has begun to be applied to small waterbodies. In the future, the multiplatform linkage monitoring approach may become a new research direction. Advanced computer technology has also enabled machine learning models to be applied to water quality parameter inversion, and machine learning models have higher robustness than the three commonly used models mentioned above. Although nitrogen and phosphorus, with nonoptical properties, have also received attention and research from some scholars in recent years, the uncertainty of their mechanisms makes it necessary to maintain a cautious attitude when treating such research.",,"This research was funded by the Major Project of Ecological Environment Management in Tianjin (grant no. 18ZXSZSF00080), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2021YFE0112000), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 51779247), and the Scientific Instrument Developing Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

Traditional models have limitations for the well production rate estimation, e.g., numerical simulations are computation-expensive, and empirical models are based on oversimplified assumptions. An artificial neural network (ANN) is an artificial intelligence method commonly used in regression problems. This work aims to apply an ANN model to estimate the oil production rate (OPR), water oil ratio (WOR), and gas oil ratio (GOR). Specifically, data analysis was first performed to select the appropriate well operation parameters for OPR, WOR, and GOR. Different ANN hyperparameters (network, training function, and transfer function) were then evaluated to determine the optimal ANN setting. Transfer function groups were further analyzed to determine the best combination of transfer functions in the hidden layers. In addition, this study adopted the relative root mean square error with the statistical parameters from a stochastic point of view to select the optimal transfer functions. The optimal ANN model's average relative root mean square error reached 6.8% for OPR, 18.0% for WOR, and 1.98% for GOR, which indicated the effectiveness of the optimized ANN model for well production estimation.

Several past studies have used gradient-based back propagation methods to train DL architectures. However, gradient-based methods have major drawbacks such as stucking at local minimums in multi-objective cost functions, expensive execution time due to calculating gradient information with thousands of iterations and needing the cost functions to be continuous. Since training the ANNs and DLs is an NP-hard optimization problem, their structure and parameters optimization using the meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms has been considerably raised. MH algorithms can accurately formulate the optimal estimation of DL components (such as hyper-parameter, weights, number of layers, number of neurons, learning rate, etc.). This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optimization of ANNs and DLs using MH algorithms. In this paper, we have reviewed the latest developments in the use of MH algorithms in the DL and ANN methods, presented their disadvantages and advantages, and pointed out some research directions to fill the gaps between MHs and DL methods. Moreover, it has been explained that the evolutionary hybrid architecture still has limited applicability in the literature. Also, this paper classifies the latest MH algorithms in the literature to demonstrate their effectiveness in DL and ANN training for various applications. Most researchers tend to extend novel hybrid algorithms by combining MHs to optimize the hyper-parameters of DLs and ANNs. The development of hybrid MHs helps improving algorithms performance and capable of solving complex optimization problems. In general, the optimal performance of the MHs should be able to achieve a suitable trade-off between exploration and exploitation features. Hence, this paper tries to summarize various MH algorithms in terms of the convergence trend, exploration, exploitation, and the ability to avoid local minima. The integration of MH with DLs is expected to accelerate the training process in the coming few years.

Specifically, MEFP adopts a dual-sides network that parallelly captures the potential outbreak patterns on the numerous input features.

To improve the stability and accuracy of streamflow forecasting, a hybrid decomposition-ensemble model named VMD-LSTM-GBRT, which is sensitive to sampling, noise and long historical changes of streamflow, was established. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm was first applied to extract features, which were then learned by several long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Simultaneously, an ensemble tree, a gradient boosting tree for regression (GBRT), was trained to model the relationships between the extracted features and the original streamflow. The outputs of these LSTMs were finally reconstructed by the GBRT model to obtain the forecasting streamflow results. A historical daily streamflow series (from 1/1/1997 to 31/12/2014) for Yangxian station, Han River, China, was investigated by the proposed model. VMD-LSTM-GBRT was compared with respect to three aspects: (1) feature extraction algorithm; ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was used. (2) Feature learning techniques; deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines for regression (SVRs) were exploited. (3) Ensemble strategy; the summation strategy was used. The results indicate that the VMD-LSTM-GBRT model overwhelms all other peer models in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE = 36.3692), determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9890), mean absolute error (MAE = 9.5246) and peak percentage threshold statistics (PPTS(5) = 0.0391%).

The chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a commonly used indicator to obtain an estimation of algal concentration. In this study, an XGBoost ensemble machine learning (ML) model was developed from eighteen input variables to predict Chl-a concentration. The composition and pretreatment of input variables to the model are important factors for improving model performance. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an emerging area of ML modeling that provides a reasonable interpretation of model performance. The effect of input variable selection on model performance was estimated, where the priority of input variable selection was determined using three indices: Shapley value (SHAP), feature importance (FI), and variance inflation factor (VIF). SHAP analysis is an XAI algorithm designed to compute the relative importance of input variables with consistency, providing an interpretable analysis for model prediction. The XGB models simulated with independent variables selected using three indices were evaluated with root mean square error (RMSE), RMSE-observation standard deviation ratio, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. This study shows that the model exhibited the most stable performance when the priority of input variables was determined by SHAP. This implies that on-site monitoring can be designed to collect the selected input variables from the SHAP analysis to reduce the cost of overall water quality analysis. The independent variables were further analyzed using SHAP summary plot, force plot, target plot, and partial dependency plot to provide understandable interpretation on the performance of the XGB model. While XAI is still in the early stages of development, this study successfully demonstrated a good example of XAI application to improve the interpretation of machine learning model performance in predicting water quality.","1.

When the reservoir becomes heterogeneous and complex, more grid blocks can be used, which requires detailed and accurate reservoir information, for e.g. porosity, permeability, and other parameters that are not always available in the field. Predicting the EUR (Estimated Ultimate Recovery) and rate decline for a single well can therefore take hours or days, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, decline curve models are a simpler and speedier option because they only require a few variables in the equation that can be easily gathered from the wells' current data. The well data for this study was gathered from the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation's publicly accessible databases. The SEDM (Stretched Exponential Decline Model) decline curve equation variables specifically designed for unconventional reservoirs variables were correlated to the predictor parameters in a random oil field well data set. The study examined the relative influences of several well parameters. The study's novelty comes from developing an innovative machine learning (ML) (random forest (RF)) based model for fast rate-decline and EUR prediction in Bakken Shale oil wells.

Assessing the resilience of water quality requires complex analysis of influential parameters which can be challenging, time consuming and costly to compute. It may also require building detailed conceptual and/or physically process-based models that are difficult to build, calibrate and validate. This study utilises Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop a novel application to predict water quality resilience to simplify resilience evaluation. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process method is used to rank water basins based on their level of resilience and to identify the ones that demand prompt restoration strategies. The commonly used 'magnitude * duration of being in failure state' quantification method has been used to formulate and evaluate resilience. A 17-years long water quality dataset from the 22 water basins in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, was used to train and test the ANN model. The overall agreement between the measured and simulated WQI resilience values is satisfactory and hence, can be used by planners and decision makers for improved water management. Moreover, comparative analyses show similarities and differences between the 'level of criticalities' reported in each zone by Environment Agency of the state of São Paulo (CETESB) and by the resilience model in this study.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

It must adhere to strict quality standards set by health organizations, be devoid of dangerous pollutants and chemicals, and meet certain requirements for safety. The health of the public and the ecosystem are directly affected by water quality. Various pollutants have posed dangers to water quality in recent years. A more efficient and affordable approach is required due to the grave effects of low water quality. In this proposed research work, deep learning algorithms are developed to predict the water quality index (WQI) and water quality classifications (WQC), which are vital parameters that can be utilized to know the status of the water. To predict the WQI, a deep learning algorithm called long short-term memory (LSTM) is used. Further, WQC is performed using a deep learning algorithm called a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed system considers seven water quality parameters, namely, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate, fecal coliform, and total coliform. The experimental results showed that the LSTM can predict water quality with superior robustness and predict WQI with the highest accuracy of 97%. Similarly, the CNN model classifies the WQC as potable or impotable with superior accuracy and a reduced error rate of 0.02.Graphical abstract",,,Analytical Sciences,,,2023-04-08,2023,2023-04-08,2023-04-08,,,1-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saroja; Haseena; Dharshini, Shri","Saroja (Department of Computer Applications, National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India); Haseena (Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi, India); Dharshini, Shri (Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi, India)",Saroja (National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli),"Saroja (National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli); Haseena (Anna University, Chennai); Dharshini, Shri (Anna University, Chennai)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s44211-023-00328-2,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157109840,40 Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,3 Good Health and Well Being; 6 Clean Water and Sanitation

The entry of groundwater into the mining pit increases costs as well as reduces efficiency and the level of work safety. Prediction of the groundwater level is a useful tool for managing groundwater resources in the mining area. In this study, to predict the groundwater level, multilayer perceptron, cascade forward, radial basis function, and generalized regression neural network models were developed. Moreover, four optimization algorithms, including Bayesian regularization, Levenberg-Marquardt, resilient backpropagation, and scaled conjugate gradient, are used to improve the performance and prediction ability of the multilayer perception and cascade forward neural networks. More than 1377 data points including 12 spatial parameters divided into two categories of sediments and bedrock (longitude, latitude, hydraulic conductivity of sediments and bedrock, effective porosity of sediments and bedrock, the electrical resistivity of sediments and bedrock, depth of sediments, surface level, bedrock level, and fault), and besides, 6 temporal parameters are used (day, month, year, drainage, evaporation, and rainfall). Also, to determine the best models and combine them, 165 extra validation data points are used. After identifying the best models from the three candidate models with a lower average absolute relative error (AARE) value, the committee machine intelligence system (CMIS) model has been developed. The proposed CMIS model predicts groundwater level data with high accuracy with an AARE value of less than 0.11%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the electrical resistivity of sediments had the highest effect on the groundwater level. Outliers' estimation applying the Leverage approach suggested that only 2% of the data points could be doubtful. Eventually, the results of modeling and estimating groundwater level fluctuations with low error indicate the high accuracy of machine learning methods that can be a good alternative to numerical modeling methods such as MODFLOW.",,,ACS Omega,,,2022-03-21,2022,2022-03-21,2022-03-29,7,12,10751-10764,All OA; Gold,Article,"Najafabadipour, Amirhossein; Kamali, Gholamreza; Nezamabadi-pour, Hossein","Najafabadipour, Amirhossein (Department of Mining Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, 76169-14111, Iran); Kamali, Gholamreza (Department of Mining Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, 76169-14111, Iran); Nezamabadi-pour, Hossein (Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, 76169-14111, Iran)","Najafabadipour, Amirhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman)","Najafabadipour, Amirhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman); Kamali, Gholamreza (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman); Nezamabadi-pour, Hossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman)",3,3,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c00536,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146456732,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Importantly, these data sets are rich in biological information with potential for predictive environmental classification and forecasting. However, the patterns in this information are often hidden amongst the inherent complexity of the data.

Due to this, the study of SF prediction is highly significant for the purpose of municipal and environmental damage mitigation. In the present study, machine learning (ML) models based on the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are tested and developed to predict SF for 11 different rivers throughout Peninsular Malaysia. SF data sets for the rivers were collected from the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage. The main objective of the present study is to propose a universal model that is most capable of predicting SFs for rivers within Peninsular Malaysia. Based on the findings, the ANN3 model which was developed using the ANN algorithm and input scenario 3 (inputs consisting of previous 3 days SF) is deduced as the best overall ML model for SF prediction as it outperformed all the other models in 4 out of 11 of the tested data sets; and obtained among the highest average RMs with a score of 3.27, hence indicating that the model is very adaptable and reliable in accurately predicting SF based on different data sets and river case studies. Therefore, the ANN3 model is proposed as a universal model for SF prediction within Peninsular Malaysia.","This study was funded by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Malaysia, via Project Research Assistantship (Project Number: UTARRPS 6251/H03).",,Scientific Reports,,Algorithms; Deep Learning; Malaysia; Rivers; Support Vector Machine,2022-03-10,2022,2022-03-10,,12,1,3883,All OA; Gold,Article,"Essam, Yusuf; Huang, Yuk Feng; Ng, Jing Lin; Birima, Ahmed H.; Ahmed, Ali Najah; El-Shafie, Ahmed","Essam, Yusuf (Department of Civil Engineering, Lee Kong Chian Faculty of Engineering and Science, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Selangor, Malaysia); Huang, Yuk Feng (Department of Civil Engineering, Lee Kong Chian Faculty of Engineering and Science, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Selangor, Malaysia); Ng, Jing Lin (Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Technology, and Built Environment, UCSI University, 56000, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); Birima, Ahmed H.

The deformation and failure mechanism of a landslide is a complex dynamic process, which seriously threatens people's lives and property. Currently, prediction and early warning of a landslide can be effectively performed by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the landslide deformation in real time and an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict the deformation trend. However, if a slope failure occurs during the construction period, the builders and decision-makers find it challenging to effectively apply IoT technology to monitor the emergency and assist in proposing treatment measures. Moreover, for projects during operation (e.g., a motorway in a mountainous area), no recognized artificial intelligence algorithm exists that can forecast the deformation of steep slopes using the huge data obtained from monitoring devices. In this context, this paper introduces a real-time wireless monitoring system with multiple sensors for retrieving high-frequency overall data that can describe the deformation feature of steep slopes. The system was installed in the Qili connecting line of a motorway in Zhejiang Province, China, to provide a technical support for the design and implementation of safety solutions for the steep slopes. Most of the devices were retained to monitor the slopes even after construction. The machine learning Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks (DeepAR) model based on time series and probabilistic forecasting was introduced into the project to predict the slope displacement. The predictive accuracy of the DeepAR model was verified by the mean absolute error, the root mean square error and the goodness of fit. This study demonstrates that the presented monitoring system and the introduced predictive model had good safety control ability during construction and good prediction accuracy during operation. The proposed approach will be helpful to assess the safety of excavated slopes before constructing new infrastructures.",,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41702297; and the Key Research and Development projects in Zhejiang Province, grant number 2019C03103.",Sensors,,,2020-12-22,2020,2020-12-22,,21,1,14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dong, Mei; Wu, Hongyu; Hu, Hui; Azzam, Rafig; Zhang, Liang; Zheng, Zengrong; Gong, Xiaonan","Dong, Mei (College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China;, 11512022@zju.edu.cn, (H.W.);, gongxn@zju.edu.cn, (X.G.)); Wu, Hongyu (College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China;, 11512022@zju.edu.cn, (H.W.);, gongxn@zju.edu.cn, (X.G.)); Hu, Hui (Hangzhou Ruhr Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310023, China;, huhui@ruhrtec.cn, (H.H.);, zhengzr@ruhrtec.cn, (Z.Z.)); Azzam, Rafig (Sino-German Resources Environment and Geo-Hazards Research Center, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou 450056, China;, azzam@lih.rwth-aachen.de; Department of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology, RWTH-Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany;, zhangl1228@126.com); Zhang, Liang (Department of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology, RWTH-Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany;, zhangl1228@126.com); Zheng, Zengrong (Hangzhou Ruhr Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310023, China;, huhui@ruhrtec.cn, (H.H.);, zhengzr@ruhrtec.cn, (Z.Z.)); Gong, Xiaonan (College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China;, 11512022@zju.edu.cn, (H.W.);, gongxn@zju.edu.cn, (X.G.))","Dong, Mei (Zhejiang University)","Dong, Mei (Zhejiang University); Wu, Hongyu (Zhejiang University); Hu, Hui (); Azzam, Rafig (North China University of Water Conservancy and Electric Power; RWTH Aachen University); Zhang, Liang (RWTH Aachen University); Zheng, Zengrong (); Gong, Xiaonan (Zhejiang University)",22,22,0.48,8.07,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/1/14/pdf?version=1608716790,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133928522,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

The development of reliable tools to monitor this contamination is an important research topic in water resources management. Indirect methods such as chlorophyll-a determination, cell counting, and toxin measurement of the cyanobacteria are tedious, cumbersome, and often lead to inaccurate results. The quantity of phycocyanin (PC) pigment is considered more appropriate for cyanobacteria monitoring. Traditional approaches for PC estimation are time-consuming, expensive, and require high expertise. Recently, some studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the amount of PC concentration. Nonetheless, most of these researches are limited to standalone modeling schemas such as artificial neural network (ANN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM). The independent schema provides imprecise results when faced with highly nonlinear systems and data uncertainties resulting from environmental disturbances. To alleviate the limitations of the existing models, this study proposes the first application of a hybrid AI model that integrates the potentials of relevance vector machine (RVM) and flower pollination algorithm (RVM-FPA) to predict the PC concentration in water resources. The performance of the hybrid model is compared with the standalone RVM model. The prediction performance of the proposed models was evaluated at two stations (stations 508 and 478) using different statistical and graphical performance evaluation methods. The results showed that the hybrid models exhibited higher performance at both stations compared to the standalone RVM model. The proposed hybrid RVM-FPA can therefore serve as a reliable predictive tool for PC concentration in water resources.",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,2021-02-24,2021,2021-02-24,2021-07,28,25,32564-32579,Closed,Article,"Pham, Quoc Bao; Sammen, Saad Sh.; Abba, Sani Isa; Mohammadi, Babak; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Abdulkadir, Rabiu Aliyu","Pham, Quoc Bao (Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, 550000, Danang, Vietnam; Faculty of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Duy Tan University, 550000, Danang, Vietnam); Sammen, Saad Sh.

Despite the latest developments in sensor technologies, real-time determination of certain parameters is not easy or uneconomical. In such cases, the use of data-derived virtual sensors can be an effective alternative. In this paper, the feasibility of virtual sensing for water quality assessment is reviewed. The review focuses on the overview of key water quality parameters for a particular use case and the development of the corresponding cost estimates for their monitoring. The review further evaluates the current state-of-the-art in terms of the modeling approaches used, parameters studied, and whether the inputs were pre-processed by interrogating relevant literature published between 2001 and 2021. The review identified artificial neural networks, random forest, and multiple linear regression as dominant machine learning techniques used for developing inferential models. The survey also highlights the need for a comprehensive virtual sensing system in an internet of things environment. Thus, the review formulates the specification book for the advanced water quality assessment process (that involves a virtual sensing module) that can enable near real-time monitoring of water quality.",,,Sensors,,"Groundwater; Linear Models; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Quality",2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,,21,21,6971,All OA; Gold,Article,"Paepae, Thulane; Bokoro, Pitshou N.; Kyamakya, Kyandoghere","Paepae, Thulane (Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Johannesburg, Doornfontein 2028, South Africa;, tpaepae@uj.ac.za); Bokoro, Pitshou N.

However, due to the comprehensive influence of climatic conditions, geographical environment, and human activities, the runoff series is nonlinear and non-stationary, and there are still great challenges in mid-long term runoff forecasting. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a novel model TVF-EMD-PE-PSO-GRU (TEPPG) was proposed in this study. Firstly, several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) were obtained by decomposing the original runoff series by time-varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD). Secondly, the permutation entropy (PE) algorithm was used to calculate the complexity of each IMF, and the IMF with similar complexity was combined. Then, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to predict each IMF after merging. Finally, the prediction results of each IMF were superimposed to obtain the final results. And compared with three models such as TVF-EMD-PSO-GRU, extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition coupled gated recurrent unit and particle swarm optimization (ESMD-PSO-GRU), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise coupled gated recurrent unit, and particle swarm optimization (CEEMDAN-PSO-GRU). The monthly and annual runoff forecasting of Tangnaihai hydrological station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and Cuntan hydrological station in the upstream of the Yangtze River was taken as examples to test the performance of the model. The results show that, compared with the other three models, the TEPPG model had the highest prediction accuracy and was relatively stable in both monthly and annual runoff forecasts.

This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics.

TOC is commonly measured experimentally; however, due to sampling restrictions, obtaining continuous data on TOC is difficult. Therefore, different empirical correlations for TOC have been presented. However, there are concerns about the generalization and accuracy of these correlations. In this paper, different machine learning (ML) techniques were utilized to develop models that predict TOC from well logs, including formation resistivity (FR), spontaneous potential (SP), sonic transit time (Δt), bulk density (RHOB), neutron porosity (CNP), gamma ray (GR), and spectrum logs of thorium (Th), uranium (Ur), and potassium (K). Over 1250 data points from the Devonian Duvernay shale were utilized to create and validate the model. These datasets were obtained from three wells; the first was used to train the models, while the data sets from the other two wells were utilized to test and validate them. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) were the ML approaches tested, and their predictions were contrasted with three empirical correlations. Various AI methods' parameters were tested to assure the best possible accuracy in terms of correlation coefficient (R) and average absolute percentage error (AAPE) between the actual and predicted TOC. The three ML methods yielded good matches; however, the RF-based model has the best performance. The RF model was able to predict the TOC for the different datasets with R values range between 0.93 and 0.99 and AAPE values less than 14%. In terms of average error, the ML-based models outperformed the other three empirical correlations. This study shows the capability and robustness of ML models to predict the total organic carbon from readily available logging data without the need for core analysis or additional well interventions.",The authors would like to thank KFUPM for giving permission to publish this work.,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Carbon; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine,2021-08-30,2021,2021-08-30,2021-08-30,2021,,7390055,All OA; Gold,Article,"Siddig, Osama; Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid; Elkatatny, Salaheldin","Siddig, Osama (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Box: 5049, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa); Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Box: 5049, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Box: 5049, Saudi Arabia, kfupm.edu.sa)","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Siddig, Osama (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",3,3,,2.2,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2021/7390055.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140781895,37 Earth Sciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

In this study Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches - Support Vector Machine, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Network- have been used to simulate the groundwater levels in the lower Tarim River basin (LTRB) which is an extreme dryland. The results showed that models developed here with easily available input data such as relative humidity, flow volume and distance to the riverbank can fully utilize spatiotemporally inconsistent groundwater monitoring data to predict the spatiotemporal variation of the groundwater system in arid regions where exist intermittent flow. The shapely additive explanations method was used to interpret the RF model and discover the effect of meteorological, hydrological and environmental variables on the regional groundwater. These explanations showed that the flow volume, the distance to the river channel and reservoir have a critical impact on groundwater changes. Within 300 m distance to the riverbank, groundwater would mainly be influenced by the flow volume and the distance to the reservoir. While far from the riverbank, these effects decreased gradually further away from the river course. The RF prediction results showed that in the next three years (2021-2023), the groundwater level on average may decline to -6.4 m, and the suitable areas for natural vegetation growth would be limited to 39% if no water conveyance in the LTRB. To guarantee the stability of ecosystems in the LTRB, it is necessary to convey the water annually. These results can support spatiotemporal predictions of groundwater levels predominantly recharged by intermittent flow, and form a scientific basis for sustainable water resources management in arid regions.","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41972244, 42171042).

They have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general, however, there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges. Here we provide such a review, covering water demand forecasting, leakage and contamination detection, sewer defect assessment, wastewater system state prediction, asset monitoring and urban flooding. We find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks, synthetic data, laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported. Leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day-to-day operation and management of urban water systems, compared with other problems reviewed. Five research challenges, i.e., data privacy, algorithmic development, explainability and trustworthiness, multi-agent systems and digital twins, are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management. Future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy. We hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world.","This work was supported by the Royal Society under the Industry Fellowship Scheme (Ref: IF160108), the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the Alan Turing Institute (Ref: EP/N510129/1) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42071272).",,Water Research,,Algorithms; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Wastewater; Water,2022-08-11,2022,2022-08-11,2022-09,223,,118973,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Fu, Guangtao; Jin, Yiwen; Sun, Siao; Yuan, Zhiguo; Butler, David","Fu, Guangtao (Centre for Water Systems, University of Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QF, United Kingdom.

Floods, being natural disasters, cannot be prevented completely; therefore, precautionary measures must be taken by the government, concerned organizations such as the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and Office for the coordination of Human Affairs, and the community to control its disastrous effects. To minimize hazards and to provide an emergency response at the time of natural calamity, various measures must be taken by the disaster management authorities before the flood incident. This involves the use of the latest cutting-edge technologies which predict the occurrence of disaster as early as possible such that proper response strategies can be adopted before the disaster. Floods are uncertain depending on several climatic and environmental factors, and therefore are difficult to predict. Hence, improvement in the adoption of the latest technology to move towards automated disaster prediction and forecasting is a must. This study reviews the adoption of remote sensing methods for predicting floods and thus focuses on the pre-disaster phase of the disaster management process for the past 20 years. A classification framework is presented which classifies the remote sensing technologies being used for flood prediction into three types, which are: multispectral, radar, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Further categorization is performed based on the method used for data analysis. The technologies are examined based on their relevance to flood prediction, flood risk assessment, and hazard analysis. Some gaps and limitations present in each of the reviewed technologies have been identified. A flood prediction and extent mapping model are then proposed to overcome the current gaps. The compiled results demonstrate the state of each technology's practice and usage in flood prediction.",,,Sensors,,Disasters; Floods; Humans; Radar; Remote Sensing Technology; Risk Assessment,2022-01-26,2022,2022-01-26,,22,3,960,All OA; Gold,Article,"Munawar, Hafiz Suliman; Hammad, Ahmed W.

While such computation devices mimic brain-inspired analog information processing, the learning procedures still rely on methods optimized for digital processing such as backpropagation, which is not suitable for physical implementation. Here, we present physical deep learning by extending a biologically inspired training algorithm called direct feedback alignment. Unlike the original algorithm, the proposed method is based on random projection with alternative nonlinear activation. Thus, we can train a physical neural network without knowledge about the physical system and its gradient. In addition, we can emulate the computation for this training on scalable physical hardware. We demonstrate the proof-of-concept using an optoelectronic recurrent neural network called deep reservoir computer. We confirmed the potential for accelerated computation with competitive performance on benchmarks.

Water saturation measurement in a core laboratory is a time-consuming and expensive task. Many scientists have attempted to estimate water saturation accurately using well-logging data, which provides a continuous record without information loss. As a result, numerous models have been developed to relate reservoir characteristics with water saturation. By expanding the use and advancement of soft computing approaches in engineering challenges, petroleum engineers applied them to estimate the petrophysical parameters of the reservoir. In this paper, two techniques are developed to estimate the water saturation in terms of porosity, permeability, and formation resistivity index through the use of 383 data sets obtained from carbonate core samples. These techniques are the nonlinear multiple regression (NLMR) technique and the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The proposed ANN model achieved outstanding performance and better accuracy for calculating the water saturation than the empirical correlation using NLMR and Archie equation with a high coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.99, a low average relative error of 1.92, a low average absolute relative error of 13.62, and a low root mean square error of 0.066.

Climate forecasts, specifically flood prediction, comprise multifaceted tasks as they are dependant on several parameters for predicting the dependant variable, which varies from time to time. Calculation of these parameters also changes with geographical location. From the time when Artificial Intelligence was first introduced to the field of hydrological modelling and prediction, it has produced enormous attention in research aspects for additional developments to hydrology. This study investigates the usability of support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and integration of SVM with particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM) models for flood forecasting. Performance of SVM solely depends on correct assortment of parameters. So, PSO method is employed in selecting SVM parameters. Monthly river flow discharge for a period of 1969 - 2018 of BP ghat and Fulertal gauging sites from Barak River flowing through Barak valley in Assam, India were used. For obtaining optimum results, different input combinations of Precipitation (Pt), temperature (Tt), solar radiation (Sr), humidity (Ht), evapotranspiration loss (El) were assessed. The model results were compared utilizing coefficient of determination (R2) root mean squared error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE). The most important results are highlighted below.•First, the inclusion of five meteorological parameters improved the forecasting accuracy of the hybrid model.•Second, model comparison specifies that hybrid PSO-SVM model executed superior performance with RMSE- 0.04962 and NSE- 0.99334 compared to BPNN and SVM models for monthly flood discharge forecasting.•Third, applied optimization algorithm has easy implementation, simple theory, and high computational efficacy.

These sediments deposit at different places depending on the discharge and course of the river. However, the deposition of these sediments impacts environmental health, agricultural activities, and portable water sources. Deposition of suspended sediments reduces the flow area, thus affecting the movement of aquatic lives and ultimately leading to the change of river course. Thus, the data of suspended sediments and their variation is crucial information for various authorities. Various authorities require the forecasted data of suspended sediments in the river to operate various hydraulic structures properly. Usually, the prediction of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is challenging due to various factors, including site-related data, site-related modelling, lack of multiple observed factors used for prediction, and pattern complexity.Therefore, to address previous problems, this study proposes a Long Short Term Memory model to predict suspended sediments in Malaysia's Johor River utilizing only one observed factor, including discharge data. The data was collected for the period of 1988–1998. Four different models were tested, in this study, for the prediction of suspended sediments, which are: ElasticNet Linear Regression (L.R.), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory. Predictions were analysed based on four different scenarios such as daily, weekly, 10-daily, and monthly. Performance evaluation stated that Long Short-Term Memory outperformed other models with the regression values of 92.01%, 96.56%, 96.71%, and 99.45% daily, weekly, 10-days, and monthly scenarios, respectively.",The author would like to thank the Department of Environment Malaysia (DOE) for providing the data.,,Scientific Reports,,,2021-04-09,2021,2021-04-09,,11,1,7826,All OA; Gold,Article,"AlDahoul, Nouar; Essam, Yusuf; Kumar, Pavitra; Ahmed, Ali Najah; Sherif, Mohsen; Sefelnasr, Ahmed; Elshafie, Ahmed","AlDahoul, Nouar (Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, 63100, Cyberjaya, Malaysia); Essam, Yusuf (Institute of Energy Infrastructure (IEI), Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), 43000, Selangor, Malaysia); Kumar, Pavitra (Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya (U.M.), 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); Ahmed, Ali Najah (Institute of Energy Infrastructure (IEI), Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), 43000, Selangor, Malaysia); Sherif, Mohsen (National Water and Energy Center, United Arab Emirates University, P.O.Box: 15551, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates; Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, College of Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, P.O.Box:15551,, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates); Sefelnasr, Ahmed (National Water and Energy Center, United Arab Emirates University, P.O.Box: 15551, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates); Elshafie, Ahmed (Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya (U.M.), 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; National Water and Energy Center, United Arab Emirates University, P.O.Box: 15551, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates)","Sherif, Mohsen (United Arab Emirates University; United Arab Emirates University)","AlDahoul, Nouar (Multimedia University); Essam, Yusuf (Universiti Tenaga Nasional); Kumar, Pavitra (University of Malaya); Ahmed, Ali Najah (Universiti Tenaga Nasional); Sherif, Mohsen (United Arab Emirates University; United Arab Emirates University); Sefelnasr, Ahmed (United Arab Emirates University); Elshafie, Ahmed (University of Malaya; United Arab Emirates University)",27,27,3.25,12.24,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87415-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137027779,37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,

Effective water demand forecasting is essential for the sustainable management of water supply systems in watersheds. To alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand in the basin, with water demand for economic growth as the main target, a hybrid moving autoregressive and deep neural network model (ARMA-DNN) was developed in this study, and four commonly used statistical indicators (MAE, RMSE, MSE, and R2) were selected to evaluate the performance of the model. Finally, the validity and practicality of the model were verified by taking the Minjiang River basin in China as an example. The results show that (a) the model can predict future water demand more accurately under the conditions of actual water consumption changes, (b) the ideal agricultural production in the Minjiang River Basin is predicted to be reached 2.26 × 109t in 2021, and (c) the highest industrial economic efficiency in Chengdu is 1.51 × 109yuan, while water satisfaction reaches 102%.

The following concepts include integrated management of water basins or continued sustainable development of water basins. Although there are not a lot of underdeveloped water basins, there have been 150 years of dam development. Dams prevent sediment from moving continuously down rivers by trapping it in reservoirs, which reduces the storage capacity and useable life of the reservoirs and prevents downstream reaches of materials necessary for channel form and aquatic ecosystems. Restricted availability of hydrological and geomorphological data hinders current knowledge of sediment characteristics and dynamics, which affects prediction models required for management. This research tested current models for estimating sediment output and transport based on data mining categorization and prediction approaches and assessed their applicability. This work brings together experience from five continents in controlling reservoir sediments and reducing downstream sediment famine of data on the distribution of sediment particle sizes, and manning's roughness coefficient were shown to have the largest influences on the predicted sediment load.

However, the discontinuous and non-stationary processes within algal dynamics still largely limit the functions of LSTMs. To overcome this challenge, an advanced time-frequency wavelet analysis (WA) technique was introduced to enhance the prediction accuracy of LSTMs. Herein, the novel hybrid approach (named WLSTM) successfully decreased the algal forecasting inaccuracy of classic LSTMs by 41% ± 8% in Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA), with powerful one-step-ahead predictions at hourly, daily, and monthly time resolutions (R2 = 0.976, 0.878, and 0.814, respectively). In addition, the WLSTM outperformed the other two widely used algal forecasting approaches - deep neural network (DNN), and autoregressive-integrated-moving-average (ARIMA) model, represented by average 72% and 85% decrease in root-mean-square-error, respectively. Furthermore, the WLSTM was implemented in an experimentally fertilized lake (Lake Tuesday, Michigan) for a multi-step forecasting examination. It satisfactorily forecasted the algal fluctuations involving substantial peak and extreme values (average R2 > 0.900) and presented accurate judgment outcomes to their bloom levels with high accuracy > 95% on average. This work highlighted the utility of deep learning approaches in effective early-warning for algal blooms, and demonstrated an important direction for improving the adaptability of conventional deep learning approaches to the aquatic problems.","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21876148), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province/Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists (LR22D06003), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M681825), the open founding from the Key Laboratory of Marine Ecological Monitoring and Restoration Technologies of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China (MEMRT202102), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (226–2022–00119), and Funding for ZJU Tang Scholar (to X.

However, these measurements take a long time and might need more than one person to be completed. The main objectives of this research are to implement artificial intelligence for predicting the mud rheology from only Marsh funnel (μf) and measuring mud density (ρm) easily and quickly on the rig site. For the first time, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to build different models for predicting the rheological properties of Max-bridge oil-based mud. The properties included the plastic viscosity (μp), yield point (γ), flow behavior index (η), and apparent viscosity (μa). Field measurements of 383 samples were used to build and optimize the ANN models. The obtained results showed that 32 neurons in the hidden layer and tan sigmoid function transfer function were the best parameters for all ANN models. The training and testing processes of models showed a strong prediction performance with a correlation coefficient (R) greater than 0.91 and an average absolute percentage error (AAPE) less than 5.31%. New empirical correlations were developed based on the optimized weights and biases of the ANN models.

Therefore, the development of a model that can predict water quality conditions in the future will have substantial societal and economic value. This can be accomplished by using a model that can predict future water quality circumstances. In this study, we employed a sophisticated artificial neural network (ANN) model. This study intends to develop a hybrid model of single exponential smoothing (SES) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to predict water quality (WQ) in different groundwater in the Al-Baha region of Saudi Arabia. Single exponential smoothing (SES) was employed as a preprocessing method to adjust the weight of the dataset, and the output from SES was processed using the BiLSTM and ANFIS models for predicting water quality. The data were randomly divided into two phases, training (70%) and testing (30%). Efficiency statistics were used to evaluate the SES-BiLSTM and SES-ANFIS models' prediction abilities. The results showed that while both the SES-BiLSTM and SES-ANFIS models performed well in predicting the water quality index (WQI), the SES-BiLSTM model performed best with accuracy (R = 99.95% and RMSE = 0.00910) at the testing phase, where the performance of the SES-ANFIS model was R = 99.95% and RMSE = 2.2941 × 100-07. The findings support the idea that the SES-BilSTM and SES-ANFIS models can be used to predict the WQI with high accuracy, which will help to enhance WQ. The results demonstrated that the SES-BiLSTM and SES-ANFIS models' forecasts are accurate and that both seasons' performances are consistent. Similar investigations of groundwater quality prediction for drinking purposes should benefit from the proposed SES-BiLSTM and SES-ANFIS models. Consequently, the results demonstrate that the proposed SES-BiLSTM and SES-ANFIS models are useful tools for predicting whether the groundwater in Al-Baha city is suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes.","This research and the APC were funded by Al Bilad Bank Scholarly Chair for Food Security in Saudi Arabia, the Deanship of Scientific Research, the Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, under grant chair number 40.

The nonlinear groundwater level fluctuations depend on the interaction of many factors such as evapotranspiration, precipitation, groundwater abstraction, and hydrogeological characteristics, making groundwater level prediction a complex task. Groundwater level changes are among the most critical issues in water resource management, which can be predicted to effectively provide management solutions to conserve renewable water resources. Understanding the aquifer status using numerical models is time-consuming and also is associated with inherent uncertainty; therefore, in recent decades, the application of artificial intelligence methods to predict water table fluctuations has significantly gained momentum. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and least square support vector machine (SVM) methods were utilized to predict groundwater level (GWL) with 1-, 2-, and 3-month lead time in Tehran-Karaj plain. Several input scenarios were developed considering groundwater levels, average temperature, total precipitation, total evapotranspiration, and average river flow on a monthly interval. The four error criteria, the correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), were the basis to evaluate the models. Results showed that all the applied methods could provide acceptable GWL prediction, but the ANFIS was the most accurate. However, the ANFIS model showed slightly better performance by yielding R = 0.98 for the training stage and R = 0.98 for the testing stage in the P84 observation well and the second combination of inputs and 1-month lead time. The outcomes also revealed that all the approaches mentioned above could appropriately predict GWL for the leading time of 1 and 2 months, but the models provided unsatisfactory results for a 3-month leading time.",,,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Fuzzy Logic; Groundwater; Iran; Rivers,2022-07-29,2022,2022-07-29,2022-09,194,9,619,Closed,Article,"Vadiati, Meysam; Rajabi Yami, Zahra; Eskandari, Effat; Nakhaei, Mohammad; Kisi, Ozgur","Vadiati, Meysam (Global Affairs, Hubert H.

In order to forecast water quality more accurately, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model by combining data decomposition, fuzzy C-means clustering and bidirectional gated recurrent unit. Firstly, the original water quality data is decomposed into several subseries by empirical wavelet transform, and then, the decomposed subseries are recombined by fuzzy C-means clustering. Next, for each clustered series, bidirectional gated recurrent unit is applied to develop prediction model. Finally, the forecast result is obtained by the summation of the predictions for the subseries. The proposed forecast model is evaluated by the water quality data of Poyang Lake, China. Results show that the proposed forecast model provides highly accurate forecast result for all of the six water quality data: the average of MAPE of the forecast results for the six water quality datasets is 4.59% for 7 day ahead prediction. Furthermore, our model shows better forecast performance than the other models. Particularly, compared with the single BiGRU model, MAPE decreased by 32.86% in average. Results demonstrate that the proposed forecast model can be used effectively for water quality forecasting.",This study is based in part upon work supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.51409189.,,Environmental Pollution,,"Cluster Analysis; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Quality",2022-03-10,2022,2022-03-10,2022-06,303,,119136,Closed,Article,"Yu, Jin-Won; Kim, Ju-Song; Li, Xia; Jong, Yun-Chol; Kim, Kwang-Hun; Ryang, Gwang-Il","Yu, Jin-Won (School of Environmental Science and Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, 300384, China; University of Science, Pyongyang, 999091, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.); Kim, Ju-Song (School of Environmental Science and Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, 300384, China; University of Science, Pyongyang, 999091, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.); Li, Xia (School of Environmental Science and Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, 300384, China.

The problem of implementing artificial intelligence on edge devices is the complexity and high resource intensity of the most known neural network data analysis methods and algorithms. The difficulty of implementing these methods on low-power microcontrollers with small memory size calls for the development of new effective algorithms for neural networks. This study presents a new method for analyzing medical data based on the LogNNet neural network, which uses chaotic mappings to transform input information. The method effectively solves classification problems and calculates risk factors for the presence of a disease in a patient according to a set of medical health indicators. The efficiency of LogNNet in assessing perinatal risk is illustrated on cardiotocogram data obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository. The classification accuracy reaches ~91% with the~3-10 kB of RAM used on the Arduino microcontroller. Using the LogNNet network trained on a publicly available database of the Israeli Ministry of Health, a service concept for COVID-19 express testing is provided. A classification accuracy of ~95% is achieved, and~0.6 kB of RAM is used. In all examples, the model is tested using standard classification quality metrics: precision, recall, and F1-measure.

Monthly evaporation (Ep) was projected by deploying three machine learning (ML) models included Extreme Gradient Boosting, ElasticNet Linear Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory; and two empirical techniques namely Stephens-Stewart and Thornthwaite. The aim of this study is to develop a reliable generalised model to predict evaporation throughout Malaysia. In this context, monthly meteorological statistics from two weather stations in Malaysia were utilised for training and testing the models on the basis of climatic aspects such as maximum temperature, mean temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and solar radiation for the period of 2000–2019. For every approach, multiple models were formulated by utilising various combinations of input parameters and other model factors. The performance of models was assessed by utilising standard statistical measures. The outcomes indicated that the three machine learning models formulated outclassed empirical models and could considerably enhance the precision of monthly Ep estimate even with the same combinations of inputs. In addition, the performance assessment showed that Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) offered the most precise monthly Ep estimations from all the studied models for both stations. The LSTM-10 model performance measures were (R2 = 0.970, MAE = 0.135, MSE = 0.027, RMSE = 0.166, RAE = 0.173, RSE = 0.029) for Alor Setar and (R2 = 0.986, MAE = 0.058, MSE = 0.005, RMSE = 0.074, RAE = 0.120, RSE = 0.013) for Kota Bharu.","The author would like to thank the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship (RTP) for its support.

The addition of certain amounts of noncondensable gases (NCG) may reduce the steam consumption, yet this requires new design-related decisions to be made. In this study, we aimed to develop a machine-learning-based forecasting model that can help in the design of SAGD applications with NCG. Experiments with or without carbon dioxide (CO2) or n-butane (n-C4H10) mixed with steam were performed in a scaled physical model to explore SAGD mechanisms. The model was filled with crushed limestone that was premixed with heavy oil of 12.4° API gravity. Throughout the experiments, temperature, pressure, and production were continuously monitored. The experimental results were used to train neural-network models that can predict oil recovery (%) and cumulative steam-oil ratio (CSOR). The input parameters included injected gas composition, prior saturation with CO2 or n-C4H10, separation between wells, and pore volume injected. Among different neural-network architectures tested, a 3-hidden-layer structure with 40, 30, and 20 neurons was chosen as the forecasting model. The model was able to predict oil recovery and CSOR with R 2 values of 0.98 and 0.95, respectively.

Shale wettability plays a crucial factor for successful CCUS projects.

The data were collected from 229 datasets of contact angle in three states of shale/oil/brine, shale/CO2/brine, and shale/CH4/brine systems. Five algorithms were used to tune MLP, while three optimization algorithms were used to optimize the RBFNN computing framework. The results indicate that the RBFNN-MVO model achieved the best predictive accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.113 and an R2 of 0.999993.

The conventional way to determine the ECD is either by carrying out the downhole tool measurements or by using mathematical models. The downhole measurement is costly and has some limitations with the practical operations, while the mathematical models do not provide a high level of accuracy. Determination of the ECD should have a high level of accuracy, and therefore, the objective of this study is to employ machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) to predict the ECD from only the drilling data with a high accuracy level. The study utilized drilling data from a horizontal drilling section that includes drilling parameters (penetration rate, rotating speed, torque, weight on bit, pumping rate, and pressure of standpipe). The models were built and tested from a data set that has 3570 data points, and another data set of 1130 measurements was employed for validating the models. The accuracy of the models was determined by key performance indices, which are the coefficient of correlation (R) and the average absolute percentage error (AAPE). The results showed the strong prediction capability for ECD from the two models through training, testing, and validation processes with R greater than 0.98 and a very low error of 0.3% for the ANN model, while ANFIS recorded R of 0.96 and AAPE of 0.7, and hence, the two models showed great performance for ECD estimation application. Also, the study introduces a newly developed equation for ECD determination from drilling data in real time.",The authors wish to acknowledge King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals and Rosewell Energy for permitting the publication of this work.,,ACS Omega,,,2021-10-05,2021,2021-10-05,2021-10-19,6,41,27430-27442,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gamal, Hany; Abdelaal, Ahmed; Elkatatny, Salaheldin","Gamal, Hany (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Abdelaal, Ahmed (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Gamal, Hany (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Abdelaal, Ahmed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",12,12,1.29,6.42,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c04363,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141645005,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,4 Quality Education

Natural fractures (NFs) significantly affect the design and performance of acid fracturing treatments. However, few models have considered the impact of NFs on acid fracturing treatments. This study presents a simple and computationally efficient model for evaluating acid fracturing efficiency in naturally fractured reservoirs using artificial intelligence-based techniques. In this work, the productivity enhancement due to acid fracturing is determined by considering the complex interactions between natural and hydraulic fractures. Several artificial intelligence (AI) techniques were examined to develop a reliable predictive model. An artificial neural network (ANN), a fuzzy logic (FL) system, and a support vector machine (SVM) were used. The developed model predicts the productivity improvement based on reservoir permeability and geomechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus and closure stress), natural fracture properties, and design conditions (i.e., acid injection rate, acid concentration, treatment volume, and acid types). Also, several evaluation indices were used to evaluate the model reliability including the correlation coefficient, average absolute percentage error, and average absolute deviation. The AI model was trained and tested using more than 3100 scenarios for different reservoir and treatment conditions. The developed ANN model can predict the productivity improvement with a 3.13% average absolute error and a 0.98 correlation coefficient, for the testing (unseen) data sets. Moreover, an empirical equation was extracted from the optimized ANN model to provide a direct estimation for productivity improvement based on the reservoir and treatment design parameters. The extracted equation was evaluated using validation data where a 4.54% average absolute error and a 0.99 correlation coefficient were achieved. The obtained results and degree of accuracy show the high reliability of the proposed model. Compared to the conventional simulators, the developed model reduces the time required for predicting the productivity improvement by more than 60-fold; therefore, it can be used on the fly to select the best design scenarios for naturally fractured formations.",,,ACS Omega,,,2021-05-18,2021,2021-05-18,2021-06-01,6,21,13654-13670,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hassan, Amjed; Aljawad, Murtada Saleh; Mahmoud, Mohamed","Hassan, Amjed (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Aljawad, Murtada Saleh (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Mahmoud, Mohamed (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia)","Hassan, Amjed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Aljawad, Murtada Saleh (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Hassan, Amjed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Aljawad, Murtada Saleh (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Mahmoud, Mohamed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",11,11,3.8,4.78,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8173587,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138153391,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

One of the most essential difficulties in the design and management of bridge piers is the estimation and modeling of scouring around the piers. The scour depth downstream of twin and three piers were simulated using a new outlier robust extreme learning machine (ORELM) model in this study. Furthermore, k-fold cross-validation with k = 4 was employed to validate the outcomes of numerical models. Four ORELM models with effective scouring parameters were first created to simulate scour depth. After then, the number of hidden layer neurons increased from two to thirty. The number of ideal hidden neurons was determined by examining the modeling results. The sigmoid activation function was also introduced as the best function. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was used to identify the superior model. The best model predicted scour depth as a function of the Froude number (Fr), the pier diameter to flow depth ratio (D/h), and the distance between the piers to flow depth ratio (d/h). The values of the objective function were accurately approximated by this model. As a result, using the ORELM model, the R2, scatter index, and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient were calculated to be 0.953, 0.146, and 0.949, respectively. The most efficient parameters for simulating the scour depth were Fr and D/h, according to the modeling results. It is worth noting that nearly half of the superior model’s simulated outputs had an inaccuracy of less than 10%. The superior model’s performance has been underestimated, according to uncertainty analysis. After that, a simple and practical equation for calculating the scour depth was established for the superior model. Additionally, the influence of each input parameter on the objective function was assessed using a partial derivative sensitivity analysis.",The author would like to thank Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz for their support.,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,2022-05-31,2022,2022-05-31,2022-10,29,49,74526-74539,Closed,Article,"Nou, Mohammad Rashki Ghaleh; Foroudi, Ali; Latif, Sarmad Dashti; Parsaie, Abbas","Nou, Mohammad Rashki Ghaleh (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Sistan and Boluchestan, Zahedan, Iran); Foroudi, Ali (Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Quchan University of Technology, Quchan, Iran); Latif, Sarmad Dashti (Civil Engineering Department, College of Engineering, Komar University of Science and Technology, 46001, Sulaimany, Kurdistan Region, Iraq); Parsaie, Abbas (Faculty of Water and Environmental Engineering, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran)","Foroudi, Ali (Quchan University of Advanced Technology)","Nou, Mohammad Rashki Ghaleh (); Foroudi, Ali (Quchan University of Advanced Technology); Latif, Sarmad Dashti (Komar University of Science and Technology); Parsaie, Abbas (Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148299023,40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Accurate forecasting of snow cover and NDVI are important issues for the reliable and efficient hydrological models and prediction of the spread of forest. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for the time series forecasting of snow cover, temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are studied in this research work. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are widely used for forecasting time series due to their adaptive computing nature. LSTM and Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are some of the several architectures provided in a class of ANN. LSTM is a kind of RNN that has the capability of learning long-term dependencies. We followed a coarse-to-fine strategy, providing reviews of various related research materials and supporting it with the LSTM analysis on the dataset of Himachal Pradesh, as gathered. Environmental factors of the Himachal Pradesh region are forecasted using the dataset, consisting of temperature, snow cover, and vegetation index as parameters from the year 2001–2017.

The three models were developed using seepage flow (Q: L/mn) and piezometer level (Z:m) measured at several piezometers placed in the corps body of the dam. The proposed models were calibrated and validated using a separate subset. Models evaluation and comparison was successfully achieved using various performances metrics, i.e., coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Experimental results showed that the proposed models are a good alternative to the in situ measured and contributed significantly in overcoming the case of missing measured seepage flow. The best performances were obtained using the RVM model with R and NSE values of ≈0.909 and ≈0.823, followed by the GPR model with R and NSE values of ≈0.891 and ≈0.767, while the SVR model was ranked as the poorest one exhibiting R and NSE values of ≈0.780 and ≈0.600, respectively. While, a growing number of investigations have focused on testing machine learning in terms of their feasibilities to accurately describe seepage flow, as well as providing important support to our understanding of the factors affecting its fluctuation, the present work was demonstrated that the combination of a wide range of variables can help in simulating seepage flow, and enhance their sensitivity which has help in developing new algorithms.Graphical abstract",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Algorithms; Machine Learning; Normal Distribution,2023-01-24,2023,2023-01-24,2023-02,30,9,24751-24763,Closed,Article,"Bouchehed, Ala; Laouacheria, Fares; Heddam, Salim; Djemili, Lakhdar","Bouchehed, Ala (Laboratory of Soils and Hydraulic, Faculty of Technology, Badji-Mokhtar Annaba University, P.O.

Because funds for monitoring HABs are limited, model development may be an alternative approach for understanding and managing HABs. Continuous monitoring based on grab sampling is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. However, improving simulation performance remains a major challenge in modeling, and current methods are limited to simulating phytoplankton (e.g., Microcystis sp., Anabaena sp., Aulacoseira sp., Cyclotella sp., Pediastrum sp., and Eudorina sp.) and zooplankton (e.g., Cyclotella sp., Pediastrum sp., and Eudorina sp.) at the genus level. The traditional modeling approach is limited for evaluating the interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Recently, deep learning (DL) models have been proposed for solving modeling problems because of their large data handling capabilities and model structure flexibilities. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of DL for simulating phytoplankton at the phylum/class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level. Our work was an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the DL model structure. The prerequisite for this model design was the data collection at two taxonomic and hierarchical levels. Our model consisted of hierarchical DL with classification transformer (TF) and regression TF models. These DL models were hierarchically connected; the output of the phylum/class level model was transferred to the genus level simulation model, and the output of the genus level model was fed into the zooplankton simulation model. The classification TF model determined the phytoplankton occurrence initiation date, whereas the regression TF model quantified the cell concentration of plankton. The hierarchical DL showed potential to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum/class and genus levels by producing average R2, and root mean standard error values of 0.42 and 0.83 [log(cells mL-1)], respectively. All simulated plankton results closely matched the measured concentrations. Particularly, the simulated cyanobacteria showed good agreement with the measured cell concentration, with an R2 value of 0.72. In addition, our simulated result showed good agreement in peak concentration compared to observations. However, a limitation remained in following the temporal variation of Tintinnopsis sp. and Bosmia sp. Using an importance map from the TF model, water temperature, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen were identified as significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms. Overall, our study demonstrated that DL can be used for modeling HABs at the phylum/class and genus levels.","This research was supported by the Korea Environment Industry Technology Institute (KEITI) through Aquatic Ecosystem Conservation Research Program, funded by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) (2020003030003) and the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (No. 2021M3E9A1103515).

This study proposes a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Firefly Algorithm (FFA), and Teleconnection Pattern Indices - such as North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Southern Oscillations (SOI), Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), and Mediterranean Oscillation (MO) - to model monthly rainfalls at the Sebaou River basin (Northern Algeria). Afterward, we compared the best-optimized MLP to the application of the Extreme Learning Machine optimized by the Bat algorithm (Bat-ELM). Assessment of the various input combinations revealed that the NAO index was the most influential parameter in improving the modeling accuracy. The results indicated that the MLP-FFA model was superior to MLP-GA and MLP-PSO for the testing phase, presenting RMSE values equal to 33.36, 30.50, and 29.92 mm, respectively. The comparison between the best MLP model and Bat-ELM revealed the high performance of Bat-ELM for rainfall modeling at the Sebaou River basin, with RMSE reducing from 29.92 to 11.89 mm and NSE value from 0.902 to 0.985 during the testing phase. This study shows that incorporating the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as a predictor improved the accuracy of artificial intelligence systems optimized by metaheuristic algorithms, specifically Bat-ELM, for rainfall modeling tasks such as filling in missing data of rainfall time series.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

This study aimed to predict evaporation from dam reservoirs using artificial intelligence considering climate change. Mahabad Dam, near Lake Urmia, in northwestern Iran, is used to investigate the proposed approach. There are three parts to the study presented herein. In the first part, two machine learning models, namely group method of data handling (GMDH) and least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), were used to model the inflow to the dam reservoir. Temperature, precipitation, and inflow during the previous month from 1990 to 2017 were used as input data. In the second part, the evaporation from the dam reservoir was modeled using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and optimized ANFIS using Harris hawks optimization (HHO) and the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) optimization algorithms. The input parameters in this part were temperature, precipitation, inflow to the dam reservoir, along with evaporation from the dam reservoir in the previous month. In the third part, precipitation and temperature were predicted using the fifth report of IPCC based on RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios for the period 2020–2040. Out of 28 models presented in the fifth report, EC-ERATH and FIO-ESM had the greatest similarity with observational data of temperature and precipitation, respectively. The results of scatter plots and Taylor’s diagram showed the higher performance of LS-SVR (root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 8.65, 4.69, and 0.96) compared to GMDH (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 11.65, 7.81, and 0.93) in modeling the inflow. Moreover, both hybrid modes (AOA-ANFIS and HHO-ANFIS) improved the performance of ANFIS in modeling the evaporation from the dam reservoir. The RMSE, MAPE, and NSE values for ANFIS were 0.56, 0.52, and 0.89, respectively, while these values for the AOA-ANFIS (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.31, 0.24, and 0.93) and HHO-ANFIS (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.20, 0.30, and 0.96) were improved remarkably. The impact of climate change reduced the inflow to the dam reservoir by about 0.45, 0.80, and 1.7 MCM in RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Also, the effect of climate change caused the evaporation from the dam reservoir to increase by about 0.2, 0.9, and 1 MCM in RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The findings of this study show that the correct management of dam reservoirs needs to consider the potential effects of climate change in the future. Moreover, the hybrid machine learning models used in this study can be used to predict the amount of evaporation in other reservoirs.",,This research is funded independently and supported by the authors.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Artificial Intelligence; Fuzzy Logic; Climate Change; Algorithms; Machine Learning,2022-11-17,2022,2022-11-17,2023-02,30,10,27912-27935,Closed,Article,"Kayhomayoon, Zahra; Naghizadeh, Fariba; Malekpoor, Mohammadreza; Arya Azar, Naser; Ball, James; Ghordoyee Milan, Sami","Kayhomayoon, Zahra (Department of Geology, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran); Naghizadeh, Fariba (Department of Water Engineering, College of Agricultural Sciences, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran); Malekpoor, Mohammadreza (Department of Civil Engineering, Azarshahr Branch, Islamic Azad University, Azarshahr, Iran); Arya Azar, Naser (Department of Water Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran); Ball, James (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia); Ghordoyee Milan, Sami (Department of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, Aburaihan Campus, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran)","Kayhomayoon, Zahra (Payame Noor University)","Kayhomayoon, Zahra (Payame Noor University); Naghizadeh, Fariba (University of Guilan); Malekpoor, Mohammadreza (Islamic Azad University of Tabriz); Arya Azar, Naser (University of Tabriz); Ball, James (University of Technology Sydney); Ghordoyee Milan, Sami (University of Tehran)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152786933,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,13 Climate Action

The ANN model is combined with traditional hydrological concepts and methods, taking the initial Antecedent Precipitation Index (API), rainfall, upstream inflow and initial flow at the forecast river section as input of model, and flood flow forecast of the next time steps as output of the model. The distributed rainfall is realized as the input of the model. The simulation is processed by dividing the watershed into several rainfall-runoff processing units. Two hidden layers are used in the ANN, and the topology of ANN is optimized by connecting the hidden layer neurons only with the input which has physical conceptual causes. The topological structure of the proposed ANN model and its information transmission process are more consistent with the physical conception of rainfall-runoff, and the weight parameters of the model are reduced. The arithmetic moving-average algorithm is added to the output of the model to simulate the pondage action of the watershed.

It requires a significant investment and expert knowledge to evaluate the EOR incremental recovery factor, design a pilot, and upscale pilot result. Water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection is one of the proven EOR technologies, with an incremental recovery factor typically ranging from 5 to 10%. The current approach of evaluating the WAG process, using reservoir modeling, is a very time-consuming and costly task. The objective of this research is to develop a fast and cost-effective mathematical model for evaluating hydrocarbon-immiscible WAG (HC-IWAG) incremental recovery factor for medium-to-light oil in undersaturated reservoirs, designing WAG pilots, and upscaling pilot results. This integrated research involved WAG literature review, WAG modeling, and selected machine learning techniques. The selected machine learning techniques are stepwise regression and group method of data handling. First, the important parameters for the prediction of the WAG incremental recovery factor were selected. This includes reservoir properties, rock and fluid properties, and WAG injection scheme. Second, an extensive WAG and waterflood modeling was carried out involving more than a thousand reservoir models. Third, WAG incremental recovery factor mathematical predictive models were developed and tested, using the group method of data handling and stepwise regression techniques. HC-IWAG incremental recovery factor mathematical models were developed with a coefficient of determination of about 0.75, using 13 predictors. The developed WAG predictive models are interpretable and user-friendly mathematical formulas. These developed models will help the subsurface teams in a variety of ways. They can be used to identify the best candidates for WAG injection, evaluate and optimize the WAG process, help design successful WAG pilots, and facilitate the upscaling of WAG pilot results to full-field scale. All this can be accomplished in a short time at a low cost and with reasonable accuracy.",The authors thank Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS for their support and permission to publish this paper.,,ACS Omega,,,2021-06-30,2021,2021-06-30,2021-07-13,6,27,17492-17500,All OA; Gold,Article,"Belazreg, Lazreg; Mahmood, Syed Mohammad; Aulia, Akmal","Belazreg, Lazreg (Department of Geosciences and Petroleum Engineering, University Teknologi PETRONAS, Jalan Desa Seri Iskandar, 32610, Bota, Perak, Malaysia); Mahmood, Syed Mohammad (Department of Geosciences and Petroleum Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Jalan Desa Seri Iskandar, 32610, Bota, Perak, Malaysia); Aulia, Akmal (Department of Subsurface Integration and Analytics, Carigali Hess Operating Company Sdn Bhd, 50450, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)","Belazreg, Lazreg (Universiti Teknologi Petronas)","Belazreg, Lazreg (Universiti Teknologi Petronas); Mahmood, Syed Mohammad (Universiti Teknologi Petronas); Aulia, Akmal ()",4,4,0.76,1.74,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280653,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139287503,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

This study investigates the groundwater quality in the Kadiri Basin, Ananthapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Groundwater samples from 77 locations were collected and tested for the concentration of various physicochemical parameters. The collected data were assimilated in the form of a groundwater quality index to estimate groundwater quality (drinking and irrigation) using an information entropy-based weight determination approach (EWQI). The water quality maps obtained from the study area suggest a definite trend in groundwater contamination of the study area. Furthermore, the influence of different physicochemical parameters on groundwater quality was determined using machine learning techniques. Learning and prediction accuracies of four different techniques, namely artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning (DL), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), were investigated. The performance of the ANN model (MEA = 11.23, RSME = 21.22, MAPE = 7.48, and R2 = 0.91) was found to be highly effective for the present dataset. The ANN model was then used to understand the relative influence of physicochemical parameters on groundwater quality. It was observed that the deterioration in groundwater quality in the study area was primarily due to the excess concentration of turbidity and iron values. The relatively higher concentration of sulfate and nitrate had caused a significant impact on the groundwater quality. The study has wider implications for modeling in similar drought-prone agricultural areas elsewhere for assessing the groundwater quality.","The authors would like to thank governmental organizations like NRSC, NBSSLUP, GSI, SOI, APSGWB, PRED, CPO, RWSSP, DWMA, and Anantapuramu for providing the data used in this study.

Based on observational data of 20 water quality parameters measured on a monthly basis at 40 stations from 2011 to 2020, this study applied different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to suggest the best option for algal bloom prediction in the Han River, a large river in South Korea. Eight different ML algorithms were categorized into several groups of statistical learning, regression family, and deep learning, and were then compared for their suitability to predict the chlorophyll-derived trophic index (TSI-Chla). ML algorithms helped identify the most important water quality parameters contributing to algal bloom prediction. The ML results confirmed that eutrophication and algal proliferation were governed by the complex interplay between nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), organic contaminants, and environmental factors. Of the models tested, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) exhibited the best performance owing to its consistent and outperforming prediction both quantitatively (i.e., via regression) and qualitatively (i.e., via classification), which was evidenced by the lowest value of mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.09, and the highest F1-score, Recall and Precision of 0.97, 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. In a further step, a representative web application was constructed to assist common users to predict the trophic status of the Han River. This study demonstrated that ML techniques are not only promising for highly accurate water quality modeling of urban rivers, but also reduce time and labor intensity for experiments, which decreases the number of monitored water quality parameters, providing further insights into the driving factors of water quality deterioration. They ultimately help devise proactive strategies for sustainable water management.",Financial support for this work was provided by the National Research Council of Science and Technology (grant No. CAP-17-05-KIGAM) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52050410336).

However, there is still much more to learn about microbial communities, including billions of novel species and genes, as well as countless spatiotemporal dynamic patterns within the microbial communities, which together form the microbial dark matter. In this work, we summarized the dark matter in microbiome research and reviewed current data mining methods, especially artificial intelligence (AI) methods, for different types of knowledge discovery from microbial dark matter. We also provided case studies on using AI methods for microbiome data mining and knowledge discovery. In summary, we view microbial dark matter not as a problem to be solved but as an opportunity for AI methods to explore, with the goal of advancing our understanding of microbial communities, as well as developing better solutions to global concerns about human health and the environment.","Acknowledgments This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 32071465, 31871334, and 31671374) and the National Key RD Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC0910502).",,Genomics Proteomics & Bioinformatics,,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Microbiota; Data Mining,2022-04-26,2022,2022-04-26,2022-10,20,5,867-881,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zha, Yuguo; Chong, Hui; Yang, Pengshuo; Ning, Kang","Zha, Yuguo (MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Hubei Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Molecular-imaging, Center of Artificial Intelligence Biology, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China); Chong, Hui (MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Hubei Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Molecular-imaging, Center of Artificial Intelligence Biology, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China); Yang, Pengshuo (MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Hubei Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Molecular-imaging, Center of Artificial Intelligence Biology, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China); Ning, Kang (MOE Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Hubei Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Molecular-imaging, Center of Artificial Intelligence Biology, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China)","Ning, Kang (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)","Zha, Yuguo (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Chong, Hui (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Yang, Pengshuo (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Ning, Kang (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)",9,9,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2022.02.007,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147369556,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

Delineating the domain composition of artificial intelligence is central to profiling and tracking its development and trajectories. This paper puts forward a bibliometric definition for artificial intelligence which can be readily applied, including by researchers, managers, and policy analysts. Our approach starts with benchmark records of artificial intelligence captured by using a core keyword and specialized journal search. We then extract candidate terms from high frequency keywords of benchmark records, refine keywords and complement with the subject category “artificial intelligence”. We assess our search approach by comparing it with other three recent search strategies of artificial intelligence, using a common source of articles from the Web of Science. Using this source, we then profile patterns of growth and international diffusion of scientific research in artificial intelligence in recent years, identify top research sponsors in funding artificial intelligence and demonstrate how diverse disciplines contribute to the multidisciplinary development of artificial intelligence. We conclude with implications for search strategy development and suggestions of lines for further research.","Na Liu acknowledges support for this research from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71702090) and the Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province (Grant No. Tsqn201909149).

The main purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive vision by reviewing a set of 43 papers about applications of Deep Learning (DL) methods to the SCM, as well as the trends, perspectives, and potential research gaps. This review uses content analysis to answer three research questions namely: 1- What SCM problems have been solved by the use of DL techniques? 2- What DL algorithms have been used to solve these problems? 3- What alternative algorithms have been used to tackle the same problems? And do DL outperform these methods and through which evaluation metrics? This review also responds to this call by developing a conceptual framework in a value-adding perspective that provides a full picture of areas on where and how DL can be applied within the SCM context. This makes it easier to identify potential applications to corporations, in addition to potential future research areas to science.

Through the analysis of complex experimental and real-time data, to improve the activity of water and wastewater treatment (WWT) systems, an artificial neural network (ANN), a computational model inspired by the human brain, and its variants were created. This review paper focuses on recent trends and advances in modeling and simulating different water and wastewater systems using ANN. This study uses ANN in watershed management, impurity removal from wastewater, and wastewater treatment plants. According to the literature review, ANN can predict nonlinear, linear, and complex systems with high accuracy and well control. Finally, the limitations and future scope of ANNs were discussed. ANN proved itself in the prediction of various water and WWT processes. Still, implementation has practical challenges, which include a lack of data availability, poorly built models, timely updates in developed models, and low repeatability. The use of a proper toolbox, faster computing power, and proper domain knowledge makes the practical implementation of ANN successful.

For this reason, the study of suspended sediment load (SSL) prediction is important for monitoring and damage mitigation purposes. The present study tests and develops machine learning (ML) models, based on the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms, to predict SSL based on 11 different river data sets comprising of streamflow (SF) and SSL data obtained from the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage. The main objective of the present study is to propose a single model that is capable of accurately predicting SSLs for any river data set within Peninsular Malaysia. The ANN3 model, based on the ANN algorithm and input scenario 3 (inputs consisting of current-day SF, previous-day SF, and previous-day SSL), is determined as the best model in the present study as it produced the best predictive performance for 5 out of 11 of the tested data sets and obtained the highest average RM with a score of 2.64 when compared to the other tested models, indicating that it has the highest reliability to produce relatively high-accuracy SSL predictions for different data sets. Therefore, the ANN3 model is proposed as a universal model for the prediction of SSL within Peninsular Malaysia.","This study was funded by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Malaysia, via Project Research Assistantship (PRA) (Project Number: UTARRPS 6251/H03).

Hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data of the groundwater wells in three periods (1996, 2007, and 2018) were used as input data for the AI methods. All the studied indicators were enrolled in feature extraction process where the most significant inputs were determined, including the studied year, the distance from the shoreline, the aquifer type, and the hydraulic head. These inputs were used to build four basic AI models to get the optimal prediction results of the used indicators (the base exchange index (BEX), the groundwater quality index for seawater intrusion (GQISWI), and water quality). The machine learning models utilized in this study are logistic regression, Gaussian process regression, feedforward backpropagation neural networks (FFBPN), and deep learning-based long-short-term memory. The FFBPN model achieved higher evaluation results than other models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 values in the testing phase, with R2 values of 0.9667, 0.9316, and 0.9259 for BEX, GQISWI, and water quality, respectively. Accordingly, the FFBPN was used to build a predictive model for electrical conductivity for the years 2020 and 2030. Reasonable results were attained despite the imbalanced nature of the dataset for different times and sample sizes.

Zeta potential is critical in assessing the stability of nanofluids and colloidal systems but measuring it can be time-consuming and challenging. The current research proposes the use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including multiple regression analyses (MRAs), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to simulate the zeta potential of silica nanofluids and colloidal systems, while accounting for affecting parameters such as nanoparticle size, concentration, pH, temperature, brine salinity, monovalent ion type, and the presence of sand, limestone, or nano-sized fine particles. Zeta potential data from different literature sources were used to develop and train the models using machine learning techniques. Performance indicators were employed to evaluate the models' predictive capabilities. The correlation coefficient (r) for the ANN, SVM, and MRA models was found to be 0.982, 0.997, and 0.68, respectively. The mean absolute percentage error for the ANN model was 5%, whereas, for the MRA and SVM models, it was greater than 25%. ANN models were more accurate than SVM and MRA models at predicting zeta potential, and the trained ANN model achieved an accuracy of over 97% in zeta potential predictions. ANN models are more accurate and faster at predicting zeta potential than conventional methods. The model developed in this research is the first ever to predict the zeta potential of silica nanofluids, dispersed kaolinite, sand-brine system, and coal dispersions considering several influencing parameters. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming experimentation and provides a highly accurate and rapid prediction method with broad applications across different fields.",The authors would like to acknowledge United Arab Emirates University for providing financial support.,This research received no external funding.,Nanomaterials,,,2023-03-29,2023,2023-03-29,,13,7,1209,All OA; Gold,Article,"Muneer, Rizwan; Hashmet, Muhammad Rehan; Pourafshary, Peyman; Shakeel, Mariam","Muneer, Rizwan (School of Mining and Geosciences, Nazarbayev University, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan); Hashmet, Muhammad Rehan (Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain 15551, United Arab Emirates); Pourafshary, Peyman (School of Mining and Geosciences, Nazarbayev University, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan); Shakeel, Mariam (School of Mining and Geosciences, Nazarbayev University, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan)","Hashmet, Muhammad Rehan (United Arab Emirates University)","Muneer, Rizwan (Nazarbayev University); Hashmet, Muhammad Rehan (United Arab Emirates University); Pourafshary, Peyman (Nazarbayev University); Shakeel, Mariam (Nazarbayev University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/13/7/1209/pdf?version=1680053799,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156622771,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering; 4018 Nanotechnology,

Then, using these variables as inputs, a neural network was trained to predict the mean soil moisture concentration over the area, also to improve the low availability due to satellite orbits. Finally, a non-linear auto regressive exogenous input (NARX) model was trained to simulate the basin level with different prediction horizons, using the data from the previous modules and past basin data (water level, discharge flow rate, and turbine flow rate). Accurate predictions of the basin water level were achieved within 1 to 6 h ahead, with mean absolute errors (MAE) between 2 cm and 10 cm, respectively.","The author wishes to acknowledge company i-EM (www.i-em.eu, accessed on 25 November 2022) for the support given in providing the data and testing the methods.",This research was funded by Hydrocontroller Regional Project.,Sensors,,"Artificial Intelligence; Water; Neural Networks, Computer; Weather; Spatial Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting",2022-12-25,2022,2022-12-25,,23,1,203,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tucci, Mauro","Tucci, Mauro (Department of Energy, Systems, Territory and Construction Engineering, University of Pisa, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 1, 56122 Pisa, Italy.)",,"Tucci, Mauro (University of Pisa)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/1/203/pdf?version=1672821781,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154020716,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Currently, there are some models available for the determination of the solution gas-oil ratio under the bubble point. However, they still may prove unreliable due to the applied assumptions and their specification to operate only under a particular range of data. In this study, the neuro-fuzzy, i.e., the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach, is utilized to develop an accurate and dependable model for determining the R s below the bubble point pressure. A total of 376 pressure-volume-temperature datasets from Sudanese oil fields were used to establish the proposed ANFIS model. The trend analysis was applied to affirm the proper relationships between the inputs and outputs. Furthermore, using different statistical error analyses, the developed model was benchmarked against widely used empirical methods to evaluate the proposed method's performance in predicting the R s at pressures below the bubble point. The proposed ANFIS model performs with an average absolute percent relative error of 10.60% and a correlation coefficient of 99.04%, surpassing the previously studied correlations.",The authors would like to express their profound gratitude to the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) for supporting this study under YUTP-Grant cost centre 015LC0-232.,,ACS Omega,,,2022-05-31,2022,2022-05-31,2022-06-14,7,23,19735-19742,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mohammed, Mohammed Abdalla Ayoub; Alakbari, Fahd Saeed; Nathan, Clarence Prebla; Mohyaldinn, Mysara Eissa","Mohammed, Mohammed Abdalla Ayoub (Petroleum Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, 32610, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia); Alakbari, Fahd Saeed (Petroleum Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, 32610, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia); Nathan, Clarence Prebla (Petroleum Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, 32610, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia); Mohyaldinn, Mysara Eissa (Petroleum Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, 32610, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia)","Mohammed, Mohammed Abdalla Ayoub (Universiti Teknologi Petronas)","Mohammed, Mohammed Abdalla Ayoub (Universiti Teknologi Petronas); Alakbari, Fahd Saeed (Universiti Teknologi Petronas); Nathan, Clarence Prebla (Universiti Teknologi Petronas); Mohyaldinn, Mysara Eissa (Universiti Teknologi Petronas)",1,1,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9202275,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148303677,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Monitoring of water quality is one of the world’s main intentions for countries. Classification techniques based on support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely used in several applications of water research. Water quality assessment with high accuracy and efficiency with innovational approaches permitted us to acquire additional knowledge and information to obtain an intelligent monitoring system. In this paper, we present the use of principal component analysis (PCA) combined with SVM and ANN with decision templates combination data fusion method. PCA was used for features selection from original database. The multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and the one-against-all strategy for SVM method have been widely used. Decision templates are applied to increase the accuracy of the water quality classification. The specific classification approach was employed to assess the water quality of the Tilesdit dam in Algeria as a study area, defined with a dataset of eight physicochemical parameters collected in the period 2009–2018, such as temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, and turbidity. The selection of the excellent parameters of the used models can be improving the performance of classification process. In order to assess their results, an experiment step using collected dataset corresponding to the accuracy and running time of training and test phases, and robustness to noise, is carried out. Various scenarios are examined in comparative study to obtain the most results of decision step with and without feature selection of the input data. From the results, we found that the integration of SVM and ANN with PCA yields accuracy up than 98%. The combination by decision templates of two classifiers SVM and ANN with PCA yields an accuracy of 99.24% using k-fold cross-validation. The combination data fusion enhanced expressively the results of the proposed monitoring framework that had proven a considerable ability in surface water quality assessment.","This work is supported by the General Directorate of Scientific Research and Technological Development, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Algeria.

Thus, the number of parameters which are trained to solve complex tasks was highly increased over the last decades. However, still the networks fail - in contrast to our brain - to develop general intelligence in the sense of being able to solve several complex tasks with only one network architecture. This could be the case because the brain is not a randomly initialized neural network, which has to be trained from scratch by simply investing a lot of calculation power, but has from birth some fixed hierarchical structure. To make progress in decoding the structural basis of biological neural networks we here chose a bottom-up approach, where we evolutionarily trained small neural networks in performing a maze task. This simple maze task requires dynamic decision making with delayed rewards. We were able to show that during the evolutionary optimization random severance of connections leads to better generalization performance of the networks compared to fully connected networks. We conclude that sparsity is a central property of neural networks and should be considered for modern Machine learning approaches.","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG, grant KR5148/2-1 to PK, project number: 436456810), and the Emergent Talents Initiative (ETI) of the University Erlangen–Nuremberg, Germany (grant 2019/2-Phil-01 to PK).",,Neural Networks,,"Brain; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Neurological; Reward",2020-05-11,2020,2020-05-11,2020-08,128,,305-312,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Gerum, Richard C; Erpenbeck, André; Krauss, Patrick; Schilling, Achim","Gerum, Richard C (Biophysics Group, Department of Physics, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Germany.); Erpenbeck, André (The Raymond and Beverley Sackler Center for Computational Molecular and Materials Science, School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University (TAU), Israel.); Krauss, Patrick (Neuroscience Lab, Experimental Otolaryngology, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany; Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Group at the Chair of English Philology and Linguistics, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Germany; Department of Otorhinolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), The Netherlands.); Schilling, Achim (Neuroscience Lab, Experimental Otolaryngology, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany; Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Group at the Chair of English Philology and Linguistics, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Germany.

Floods and torrential rains erode riverbeds and damage cross-river structures, causing bridge collapse and a severe threat to property and life. Reductions in bridge-safety capacity need to be monitored during flood periods to protect the traveling public. In the present study, a scour monitoring system designed with vibration-based arrayed sensors consisting of a combination of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is developed and implemented to obtain real-time scour depth measurements. These vibration-based micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors are packaged in a waterproof stainless steel ball within a rebar cage to resist a harsh environment in floods. The floodwater-level changes around the bridge pier are performed using real-time CCTV images by the Mask R-CNN deep learning model. The scour-depth evolution is simulated using the hydrodynamic model with the selected local scour formulas and the sediment transport equation. The laboratory and field measurement results demonstrated the success of the early warning system for monitoring the real-time bridge scour-depth evolution.","The authors acknowledge the Directorate General of Highways, Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the National Applied Research Laboratories, Taiwan, for the valuable data provided in this study.

However, for various reasons, water quality data are often High-Dimension, Low-Sample- Size (HDLSS), meaning the sample size is lower than the number of dimensions. Moreover, imbalance problems may arise due to bias in the occurrence frequency of Microcystis. These problems make predicting the occurrence of Microcystis and analyzing its causes with machine learning difficult. In this study, a machine learning model that applies Feature Engineering (FE) and Feature Selection (FS) algorithms are used to predict outbreaks of Microcystis and analyze the outbreak factors from imbalanced HDLSS water quality data. The prediction performance was verified with binary classification to determine whether Microcystis would occur in the future by applying three machine learning models to four data patterns. The cause analysis of Microcystis occurrence was performed by visualizing the results of applying FE and FS. For the test data, the predictive performance of FE and FS methods was significantly better than that of the conventional method, with an accuracy of .108 points and an F-value of .691 points higher than the conventional method. A prediction performance increase was observed with a smaller model capacity. Data-driven analysis suggested that total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen saturation, and water temperature are associated with Microcystis occurrences. The results also indicated that basic statistics of the water quality distribution (especially mean, standard deviation, and skewness) over a year, not the concentrations of water components, are related to the occurrence of Microcystis. These are new findings not found in previous studies and are expected to contribute significantly to future studies of algae. This study provides a method for analyzing water quality data with high-dimensionality and small samples, imbalance problems, or both.","We would like to thank Mr. Asahi Hentona (AI Shift, inc.) for his corrections and advice on this paper.

The study determined the effects of increased water temperatures in artificial lakes during winter on predicting changes in the biomass of zooplankton taxa and their environment. We applied an innovative approach to investigate the effects of winter warming on zooplankton and physico-chemical factors. We used a modelling scheme combining hierarchical clustering, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithms. Under the influence of increased water temperatures in winter, weight- and frequency-dominant Crustacea taxa such as Daphnia cucullata, Cyclops vicinus, Cryptocyclops bicolor, copepodites and nauplii, and the Rotifera: Polyarthra longiremis, Trichocerca pusilla, Keratella quadrata, Asplanchna priodonta and Synchaeta spp. tend to decrease their biomass. Under the same conditions, Rotifera: Lecane spp., Monommata maculata, Testudinella patina, Notholca squamula, Colurella colurus, Trichocerca intermedia and the protozoan species Centropyxis acuelata and Arcella discoides with lower size and abundance responded with an increase in biomass. Decreases in chlorophyll a, suspended solids and total nitrogen were predicted due to winter warming.

To quickly respond to water pollution, it is important for water management staff to predict water quality changes in advance. Drawing on the temporality of water quality data, the leaky integrator echo state network (ESN) was introduced to construct the water quality prediction models for dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (CODMn), and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. First, the missing values were filled by the linear trend method of adjacent points, and the outliers were detected and corrected by the Z-score method and the linear trend method. Second, the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was performed to denoise the original monitoring data, such that the predicted data catch up with the real data, and the model accuracy is not affected by the hidden noise in the data. Third, the correlation between water quality indices was measured by the maximum information coefficient (MIC), and the strongly correlated indices were imported to the prediction model. Finally, according to these strong correlation indicators, the water quality prediction models based on multiple features were constructed, respectively, using the offline and online learning algorithms of the ESN.

Total organic carbon (TOC) is a significant measure of the quality of unconventional resources. Conventionally, TOC is measured experimentally; however, continuous information about TOC is hard to obtain due to the samples' limitations, while the developed empirical correlations for TOC were found to have modest accuracy when applied in different datasets. In this paper, data from Devonian Duvernay shale were used to develop an optimized empirical correlation to predict TOC based on an artificial neural network (ANN). Three wells' datasets were used to build and validate the model containing over 1250 data points, and each data point includes values for TOC, density, porosity, resistivity, gamma ray and sonic transient time, and spectral gamma ray. The three datasets were used separately for training, testing, and validation. The results of the developed correlation were compared with three available models. A sensitivity and optimization test was performed to reach the best model in terms of average absolute percentage error (AAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) between the actual and predicted TOC. The new correlation yielded an excellent match with the actual TOC values with R values above 0.93 and AAPE values lower than 14%. In the validation dataset, the correlation outperformed the other empirical correlations and resulted in less than 10% AAPE, in comparison with over 20% AAPE in other models. These results imply the applicability of this correlation; therefore, all the correlation's parameters are reported to allow its use on different datasets.",The authors would like to thank KFUPM for giving permission to publish this work.,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,"Carbon; Gamma Rays; Neural Networks, Computer",2021-07-22,2021,2021-07-22,2021-07-22,2021,,2486046,All OA; Gold,Article,"Siddig, Osama; Mahmoud, Ahmed Abdulhamid; Elkatatny, Salaheldin; Soupios, Pantelis","Siddig, Osama (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, Box 5049, kfupm.edu.sa); Mahmoud, Ahmed Abdulhamid (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, Box 5049, kfupm.edu.sa); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, Box 5049, kfupm.edu.sa); Soupios, Pantelis (Department of Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia, Box 5049, kfupm.edu.sa)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Siddig, Osama (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Mahmoud, Ahmed Abdulhamid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Soupios, Pantelis (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",5,5,,3.66,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2021/2486046.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139941549,37 Earth Sciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

The miniaturization, stimulated tissue mechanical forces, and microenvironment of OoCs offer unique properties for biomedical applications. However, the large amount of data generated by the high parallelization of OoC systems has grown far beyond the scope of manual analysis by researchers with biomedical backgrounds. Deep learning, an emerging area of research in the field of machine learning, can automatically mine the inherent characteristics and laws of ""big data"" and has achieved remarkable applications in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The integration of deep learning in OoCs is an emerging field that holds enormous potential for drug development, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. This review briefly describes the basic concepts and mechanisms of microfluidics and deep learning and summarizes their successful integration. We then analyze the combination of OoCs and deep learning for image digitization, data analysis, and automation. Finally, the problems faced in current applications are discussed, and future perspectives and suggestions are provided to further strengthen this integration.","This work was financially supported by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (2020YFA0709900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22077101, 22004099, and 62001003), the Joint Research Funds of Department of Science &amp; Technology of Shaanxi Province and Northwestern Polytechnical University (2020GXLH-Z-008, 2020GXLH-Z-021, and 2020GXLH-Z-023), the Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo (202003N4049 and 202003N4065), the Open Project Program of the Analytical &amp; Testing Center of Northwestern Polytechnical University (2020T018), the Open Project Program of Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (No. 2020WNLOKF023), the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi (2020ZDLGY13-04 and 2021KW-49), the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (2008085QF284), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M671851), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,Research,,,2022-01-19,2022,2022-01-19,2022-01,2022,,1-20,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Jintao; Chen, Jie; Bai, Hua; Wang, Haiwei; Hao, Shiping; Ding, Yang; Peng, Bo; Zhang, Jing; Li, Lin; Huang, Wei","Li, Jintao (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China); Chen, Jie (Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing of Ministry of Education, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, China; Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Hefei 230088, China); Bai, Hua (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China); Wang, Haiwei (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China); Hao, Shiping (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China); Ding, Yang (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China); Peng, Bo (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China); Zhang, Jing (College of Biomedical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China); Li, Lin (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China; Key Laboratory of Flexible Electronics (KLOFE) and Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM) Nanjing Tech University (NanjingTech), Nanjing 211800, China); Huang, Wei (Frontiers Science Center for Flexible Electronics, Xi'an Institute of Flexible Electronics (IFE) and Xi'an Institute of Biomedical Materials & Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China; Key Laboratory of Flexible Electronics (KLOFE) and Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM) Nanjing Tech University (NanjingTech), Nanjing 211800, China)","Peng, Bo (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Li, Lin (Northwestern Polytechnical University; Nanjing Tech University); Huang, Wei (Northwestern Polytechnical University; Nanjing Tech University)","Li, Jintao (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Chen, Jie (Anhui University; China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (China)); Bai, Hua (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Wang, Haiwei (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Hao, Shiping (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Ding, Yang (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Peng, Bo (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Zhang, Jing (Sichuan University); Li, Lin (Northwestern Polytechnical University; Nanjing Tech University); Huang, Wei (Northwestern Polytechnical University; Nanjing Tech University)",17,17,,,https://downloads.spj.sciencemag.org/research/2022/9869518.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144805485,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study assessed the uncertainty (with 95% confidence limits) and interpretability of two deep learning (DL) models (deep boltzmann machine—DBM) and a one dimensional convolutional neural networks (1DCNN)—long short-term memory (LSTM) hybrid model (1DCNN-LSTM) for mapping soil salinity by applying DeepQuantreg and game theory (Shapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and permutation feature importance measure (PFIM)), respectively. Based on stepwise forward regression (SFR)—a technique for controlling factor selection, 18 of 47 potential controls were selected as effective factors. Inventory maps of soil salinity were generated based on 476 surface soil samples collected for measuring electrical conductivity (ECe). Based on Taylor diagrams, both DL models performed well (RMSE < 20%), but the 1DCNN-LSTM hybrid model performed slightly better than the DBM model. The uncertainty range associated with the ECe values predicted by both models estimated using DeepQuantilreg were similar (0–25 dS/m for the 1DCNN-LSTM hybrid model and 2–27 dS/m for DBM model). Based on the SFR and PFIM (permutation feature importance measure)—a measure in game theory, four controls (evaporation, sand content, precipitation and vertical distance to channel) were selected as the most important factors for soil salinity in the study area. The results of SHAP (Shapely Additive exPlanations)—the second measure used in game theory—suggested that five factors (evaporation, vertical distance to channel, sand content, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and digital elevation model (DEM)) have the strongest impact on model outputs. Overall, the methodology used in this study is recommend for applications in other regions for mapping environmental problems.","The authors would like to thank the Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Hormozgan, Iran for supporting this joint research project.",,Scientific Reports,,Deep Learning; Game Theory; Salinity; Sand; Soil; Uncertainty,2022-09-07,2022,2022-09-07,,12,1,15167,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mohammadifar, Aliakbar; Gholami, Hamid; Golzari, Shahram","Mohammadifar, Aliakbar (Department of Natural Resources Engineering, University of Hormozgan, Bandar-Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran); Gholami, Hamid (Department of Natural Resources Engineering, University of Hormozgan, Bandar-Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran); Golzari, Shahram (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Hormozgan, Bandar-Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran; Deep Learning Research Group, University of Hormozgan, Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran)","Gholami, Hamid (Hormozgan University)","Mohammadifar, Aliakbar (Hormozgan University); Gholami, Hamid (Hormozgan University); Golzari, Shahram (Hormozgan University; Hormozgan University)",2,2,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19357-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150825683,41 Environmental Sciences; 4106 Soil Sciences,

In this work, we demonstrated on-demand creation of artificial neurons, synapses, and memory capacitors in post-fabricated perovskite NdNiO3 devices that can be simply reconfigured for a specific purpose by single-shot electric pulses. The sensitivity of electronic properties of perovskite nickelates to the local distribution of hydrogen ions enabled these results. With experimental data from our memory capacitors, simulation results of a reservoir computing framework showed excellent performance for tasks such as digit recognition and classification of electrocardiogram heartbeat activity. Using our reconfigurable artificial neurons and synapses, simulated dynamic networks outperformed static networks for incremental learning scenarios.

However, the computational cost of reinforcement learning with deep neural networks is extremely high and reducing the learning cost is a challenging issue. We propose a photonic on-line implementation of reinforcement learning using optoelectronic delay-based reservoir computing, both experimentally and numerically. In the proposed scheme, we accelerate reinforcement learning at a rate of several megahertz because there is no required learning process for the internal connection weights in reservoir computing. We perform two benchmark tasks, CartPole-v0 and MountanCar-v0 tasks, to evaluate the proposed scheme. Our results represent the first hardware implementation of reinforcement learning based on photonic reservoir computing and pave the way for fast and efficient reinforcement learning as a novel photonic accelerator.","This study was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI (JP19H00868 and JP20K15185), JST CREST JP-MJCR17N2, and the Telecommunications Advancement Foundation.",,Scientific Reports,,,2022-03-08,2022,2022-03-08,,12,1,3720,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kanno, Kazutaka; Uchida, Atsushi","Kanno, Kazutaka (Department of Information and Computer Sciences, Saitama University, 255 Shimo-Okubo, Sakura-ku, 338–8570, Saitama City, Saitama, Japan); Uchida, Atsushi (Department of Information and Computer Sciences, Saitama University, 255 Shimo-Okubo, Sakura-ku, 338–8570, Saitama City, Saitama, Japan)","Kanno, Kazutaka (Saitama University)","Kanno, Kazutaka (Saitama University); Uchida, Atsushi (Saitama University)",4,4,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07404-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146117990,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4611 Machine Learning,

These stresses can be estimated using theoretical equations in addition to some field tests, i.e., leak-off test to include the effect of tectonic stress. This approach is associated with many technical and financial issues. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide a novel machine learning-based solution to estimate these stresses while drilling. First, new models were developed using artificial neural network (ANN) to directly predict σ min and σ max from the drilling data; which are injection rate (Q), standpipe pressure (SPP), weight on bit (WOB), torque (T), and rate of penetration (ROP). Such data are always available while drilling, and hence, no additional cost is required. Actual data from a Middle Eastern field were collected, statistically analyzed, and fed to the models. First, the models' predictions showed a significant match with the actual stress values with a correlation coefficient (R-value) exceeding 0.90 and a mean absolute average error (MAPE) of 0.75% as a maximum. Second, new empirical equations were generated based on the developed ANN-based models. The new equations were then validated using another unseen dataset from the same field. The predictions had an R-value of 0.98 and 0.93 in addition to MAPE of 0.36% and 0.96% for σ min and σ max models, respectively.

Multi-point geostatistics (MPG) method can learn a priori geological model and can realize multi-point correlation simulation in space, while deep neural network can express nonlinear relationship well. This article comprehensively utilizes the advantages of the two to try to optimize the multi-point geostatistical reservoir facies modeling algorithm based on the Deep Forward Neural Network (DFNN). Through the optimization design of the multi-grid training data organization form and repeated simulation of grid nodes, the simulation results of diverse modeling algorithm parameters, data conditions and deposition types of sedimentary microfacies models were compared. The results show that by optimizing the organization of multi-grid training data and repeated simulation of nodes, it is easier to obtain a random simulation close to the real target, and the simulation of sedimentary microfacies of different scales and different sedimentary types can be performed.","This study was supported by the Major National Science and Technology Projects of China in the form of grants awarded to MP (2017ZX05013-002-002, 2016ZX0510-001), PetroChina in the form of salaries for WL, YL, and XC, and Sinopec in the form of a salary for QL.

The current work proposed the implementation of five different stand-alone techniques coupled with four different novel hybridized paradigms for the clinical prediction of hepatitis C status among patients, using both sociodemographic and clinical input variables. Both the visualized and quantitative performances of the stand-alone algorithms present the capability of the Gaussian process regression (GPR), Generalized neural network (GRNN), and Interactive linear regression (ILR) over the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models. Hence, due to the lower performance of the stand-alone algorithms at a certain point, four different novel hybrid data intelligent algorithms were proposed, including: interactive linear regression-Gaussian process regression (ILR-GPR), interactive linear regression-generalized neural network (ILR-GRNN), interactive linear regression-Support Vector Regression (ILR-SVR), and interactive linear regression-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ILR-ANFIS), to boost the prediction accuracy of the stand-alone techniques in the clinical prediction of hepatitis C among patients. Based on the quantitative prediction skills presented by the novel hybridized paradigms, the proposed techniques were able to enhance the performance efficiency of the single paradigms up to 44% and 45% in the calibration and validation phases, respectively.","The authors are grateful to the Operational Research Centre in Healthcare, Near East University, North Cyprus, Mersin-10, Türkiye, for supporting this study.",This research received no external funding.,Life,,,2022-12-27,2022,2022-12-27,,13,1,79,All OA; Gold,Article,"Madaki, Zachariah; Abacioglu, Nurettin; Usman, A G; Taner, Neda; Sehirli, Ahmet O; Abba, S I","Madaki, Zachariah (Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Near East University, North Cyprus, Mersin-10, 99138 Nicosia, Türkiye.); Abacioglu, Nurettin (Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Near East University, North Cyprus, Mersin-10, 99138 Nicosia, Türkiye.); Usman, A G (Operational Research Centre in Healthcare, Near East University, North Cyprus, Mersin-10, 99138 Nicosia, Türkiye.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Near East University, North Cyprus, Mersin-10, 99138 Nicosia, Türkiye.); Taner, Neda (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul Medipol University, 34810 Istanbul, Türkiye.); Sehirli, Ahmet O (Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Dentistry, Nicosia, Near East University, North Cyprus, Mersin-10, 99138 Nicosia, Türkiye.); Abba, S I (Interdisciplinary Research Centre for Membrane and Water Security, Faculty of Petroleum and Minerals, King Fahd University, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.)","Usman, A G (Near East University; Near East University); Abba, S I (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Madaki, Zachariah (Near East University); Abacioglu, Nurettin (Near East University); Usman, A G (Near East University; Near East University); Taner, Neda (Istanbul Medipol University); Sehirli, Ahmet O (Near East University); Abba, S I (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/13/1/79/pdf?version=1672147969,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154046706,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,3 Good Health and Well Being

8068,pub.1134988242,10.1109/tnnls.2021.3051384,33513115,,A Hybrid System Based on Dynamic Selection for Time Series Forecasting,"Hybrid systems, which combine statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques using residual (error forecasting) modeling, have been highlighted in the literature due to their accuracy and ability to forecast time series with different characteristics. In these architectures, a crucial task is the proper modeling of the residuals since they may present random fluctuations, complex nonlinear patterns, and heteroscedastic behavior. Hence, the selection, specification, and training of one ML model to forecast the residuals are costly and challenging tasks since issues, such as underfitting, overfitting, and misspecification, can lead to a system with low accuracy or even deteriorate the linear forecast of the time series. This article proposes a hybrid system, named dynamic residual forecasting (DReF), that employs a modified dynamic selection (DS) algorithm to decide: the most suitable ML model to forecast a pattern of the residual series and if it is a promising candidate to increase the accuracy of the time series forecast from the linear combination. Thus, the DReF aims to reduce the uncertainty of the ML model selection and avoid the deterioration of the time series forecast. Furthermore, the proposed system searches for the most suitable parameters of the DS algorithm for each data set. In this article, the proposed method uses a pool of five ML models widely adopted in the literature: multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, radial basis function, long short-term memory, and convolutional neural network. An experimental evaluation was conducted using ten well-known time series. The results show that the DReF obtains superior results for the majority of the data sets compared with single and hybrid models of the literature.",,This work was supported in part by the Brazilian agencies: CNPq and Facepe and in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior–Brazil (CAPES)–Finance Code 001.,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,,2022-08-03,2022,2022-08-03,2022-08,33,8,3251-3263,Closed,Article,"de Oliveira, João F.

In spite of its importance, there are still many groundwater bodies in which there is not enough monitoring data to define classic distributed mathematical models to forecast future potential levels. The main aim of this study is to propose and evaluate a novel parsimonious integrated method for the short-term forecasting of groundwater levels. It has low requirements in term of data, and it is operational and relatively easy to apply. It uses geostatistics, optimal meteorological exogenous variables and artificial neural networks. We have illustrated our method in the aquifer ""Campo de Montiel"" (Spain). The analysis of optimal exogenous variables revealed that, in general, the wells with stronger correlations with precipitation are located closer to the central part of the aquifer. NAR, which does not consider secondary information, is the best approach for 25.5 % of the cases and is associated with well locations with lower R2 between groundwater levels and precipitation. Amongst the approaches with exogenous variables, the ones that use effective precipitation have been selected more times as the best experiments. NARX and Elman using effective precipitation had the best approaches with 21.6 % and 29.4 % of the cases respectively. For the selected approaches, we obtained a mean RMSE of 1.14 m in the test and 0.76, 0.92, 0.92, 0.87, 0.90, and 1.05 m for the forecasting test for months 1 to 6 respectively for the 51 wells, but the accuracy of the results can vary depending on the well. The interquartile range of the RMSE is around 2 m for the test and forecasting test. The uncertainty of the forecasting is also considered by generating multiple groundwater level series.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research was partially supported by the Regional Ministry of Economic Transformation, Industry, Knowledge and Universities of the Regional Government of Andalusia through the post-doc programme of the Andalusian Plan for Research Development and Innovation (PAIDI 2021) (POSTDOC_21_00154, University of Granada, Antonio-Juan Collados-Lara), and the research projects SIGLO-AN (RTI2018-101397-B-I00) and SIGLO-PRO (PID2021-128021OB-I00) from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and the WP4 (Appraisal, protection sustainable use of Europe's groundwater resources) of the CSA project A Geological Service for Europe (GSEU) (HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-02-14CSA).

In this paper, to address the problem of low prediction accuracy of existing empirical models due to the non-smoothness and nonlinearity of water quality series, a novel water quality forecasting model integrating synchrosqueezed wavelet transform and deep extreme learning machine optimized with the sparrow search algorithm (SWT-SSA-DELM) was proposed. First, the water quality series was denoised by SWT to reduce the non-stationarity and randomness of water quality series. Then, construct DELM by combining ELM and an autoencoder, and an innovative metaheuristic algorithm, SSA, was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the DELM. Finally, the constructed feature vector was used as the input of the DELM, and the proposed water quality prediction model SWT-SSA-DELM was trained and tested with the data sets of Xinchengqiao and Xiaolangdi in the Yellow River Basin, China. Models such as ELM and DELM alone, as well as their improved form based on ensemble learning, long short-term memory network (LSTM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) were adopted as comparison models. The results make it evident that the model presented, linking the ability to ensure convergence to the global optima of the SSA with the nonlinear mapping of the DELM, outperforms similar models in terms of predictive performance, with average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of 0.15, 2.02%, and 0.21 in the test stage, which is 72.82%, 72.88%, and 74.32% lower than the baseline ELM model, respectively.",We sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers for their time and effort devoted to improving the manuscript.,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Rivers; Water Quality; Wavelet Analysis,2022-01-24,2022,2022-01-24,2022-05,29,25,38066-38082,Closed,Article,"Song, Chenguang; Yao, Leihua","Song, Chenguang (School of Engineering and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 100083, Beijing, China); Yao, Leihua (School of Engineering and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 100083, Beijing, China)","Yao, Leihua (China University of Geosciences)","Song, Chenguang (China University of Geosciences); Yao, Leihua (China University of Geosciences)",6,6,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144929573,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

However, forecasting becomes challenging without weather and upstream reservoir outflows forecasts in real-time. In this context, a novel hybrid approach is proposed in this study to forecast the streamflows and reservoir outflows in real-time. In this approach, the Explainable Machine Learning model is embedded with a conceptual reservoir module for forecasting streamflows using short-term weather forecasts. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a Machine Learning model, is used in this study to predict the streamflow, and the model's explainability is examined by Shapley additive explanations method (SHAP). Panchet reservoir catchment, which contains Tenughat and Konar reservoirs, is selected as a study area. The LSTM model performance is excellent in predicting the streamflows of Tenughat, Konar and Panchet catchments with NSE values of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.96, respectively. The SHAP method identified the high-impact variables as streamflows and precipitation of 1-day lag. In forecasting, bias-corrected Global Forecast System data is used with the LSTM model to forecast the streamflows in three catchments. The inflows are forecasted well up to a 3-day lead in Tenughat and Konar reservoirs with NSE values above 0.88 and 0.87, respectively. The reservoir module performance in forecasting Tenughat and Konar reservoirs' outflows with the inflow forecasts is also promising up to a 3-day lead with NSE values above 0.88 for both reservoirs. The inflows forecasting to Panchet reservoir with reservoirs' outflows as additional inputs is excellent up to 5-day lead (NSE = 0.96-0.88). However, the forecasting error increased from 77 m3/s to 134 m3/s with the lead time.

It was developed a methodology to detect and quantify the maximum thickness of eccentric scale inside pipelines using nuclear techniques and an artificial neural network. The measurement procedure is based on gamma-ray scattering using NaI(Tl) detectors and a137Cs radiation source that emits gamma-rays of 662 keV. The simulations considered an annular flow regime composed of barium sulfate scale, oil, saltwater and gas, and three percentages of these fluids were used. In the present investigation, a study of detectors configuration was carried out to improve the measurement geometry and the simulations were made using the MCNP6 code, which is a mathematical code based on the Monte Carlo method. The counts registered in the detectors were used as input data to train a deep neural network (DNN) that uses rectifier activation functions instead of the usually sigmoid-based ones. In addition, a hyperparameters search was made using open software to develop the final DNN architecture. Results showed that the best detector configuration was able to predict 100% of the patterns with the maximum relative error of 5%. Moreover, the achieved mean absolute percentage error was 0.42% and the regression coefficient was 0.99996 for all data.

This study investigated the role of rainfall thresholds in suspended sediment modeling in semiarid catchments. The results showed that rainfall-sediment in the study catchment (HMTC) could be grouped into two patterns on the basis of rainfall threshold 10 mm. The sediment modeling based on LSTM model with the rainfall threshold (C-LSTM scheme) and without threshold (LSTM scheme) were evaluated and compared. The results showed that the C-LSTM scheme had much better performances than LSTM scheme, especially for the low sediment conditions. It was observed that in the study catchment, the mean NSE was marginally improved from 0.925 to 0.934 for calibration and 0.911 to 0.924 for validation for medium and high sediment (Pattern 1); while for low sediment (Pattern 2), the mean NSE was significantly improved from -0.375 to 0.738 for calibration and 0.171 to 0.797 for validation. Results of this study indicated rainfall thresholds were very effective in improving suspended sediment simulation. It was suggested that the incorporation of more information such as rainfall intensity, land use, and land cover may lead to further improvement of sediment prediction in the future.",This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFC1510700) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51979177).,,Scientific Reports,,,2022-03-21,2022,2022-03-21,,12,1,4816,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yin, Zhaorui; Qin, Guanghua; Guo, Li; Tang, Xuan; Wang, Jinxing; Li, Hongxia","Yin, Zhaorui (State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, 610065, Chengdu, China); Qin, Guanghua (State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, 610065, Chengdu, China); Guo, Li (State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, 610065, Chengdu, China); Tang, Xuan (State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, 610065, Chengdu, China); Wang, Jinxing (Information Center (Hydrology Monitor and Forecast Center), Ministry of Water Resources of the People’s Republic of China, 100053, Beijing, China); Li, Hongxia (State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, 610065, Chengdu, China)","Li, Hongxia (Sichuan University)","Yin, Zhaorui (Sichuan University); Qin, Guanghua (Sichuan University); Guo, Li (Sichuan University); Tang, Xuan (Sichuan University); Wang, Jinxing (Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China); Li, Hongxia (Sichuan University)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08342-6.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146456967,37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology,15 Life on Land

Most of the traditional ROP prediction methods are based on building physical model and single intelligent algorithms, and the efficiency and accuracy of these prediction methods are very low. With the development of artificial intelligence, high-performance algorithms make reliable prediction possible from the data perspective. To improve ROP prediction efficiency and accuracy, this paper presents a method based on particle swarm algorithm for optimization of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. In this paper, we consider the Tuha Shengbei block oilfield as an example. First, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the correlation between the characteristics and eight parameters are screened out, namely, the depth of the well, gamma, formation density, pore pressure, well diameter, drilling time, displacement, and drilling fluid density. Second, the PSO algorithm is employed to optimize the super-parameters in the construction of the LSTM model to the predict ROP. Third, we assessed model performance using the determination coefficient (R 2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The evaluation results show that the optimized LSTM model achieves an R 2 of 0.978 and RMSE and MAPE are 0.287 and 12.862, respectively, hence overperforming the existing methods. The average accuracy of the optimized LSTM model is also improved by 44.2%, indicating that the prediction accuracy of the optimized model is higher. This proposed method can help to drill engineers and decision makers to better plan the drilling operation scheme and reduce the drilling cycle.","This work was supported in part by the Major National Science and Technology projects during the 13th Five Year Plan (2016ZX05061-009), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2018CFB770), and the COSL Science and Technology Project (G2017A-0211 T231).

Therefore, machine learning models that can give reliable predictive results with the least information available have been recommended for evaporation prediction. This study was conducted in the central of Iran using the data related to the Doroudzan dam. Several hydrological and meteorological variables, including inflow and outflow of the reservoir, lake area behind the dam, temperature, overflow from the reservoir, precipitation, and evaporation at the previous month, were considered input data to predict the evaporation at the current month. Monthly data from October 1999 to September 2020 were used during the modeling. First, the single adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) models were evaluated for predicting the amount of evaporation using different scenarios defined based on the different combinations of input variables. The results showed that LS-SVR with RMSE = 2.77, MAPE = 2.48, and NSE = 0.93 provided a better prediction than ANFIS. Second, the Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of ANFIS to check for the possibility of performance improvement. The hybrid ANFIS-HHO model predicted the evaporation with RMSE = 2.35, MAPE = 1.55, and NSE = 0.95, respectively. The Taylor’s diagram also demonstrated the superior performance of the hybrid ANFIS-HHO model than the LS-SVR and ANFIS models. The best scenario for all three models included all input variables but the area behind the dam into the models. The methodology proposed in this study is useful for predicting the evaporation from dam reservoirs under the influence of various dam variables.",,,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrology; Meteorology,2021-10-07,2021,2021-10-07,2021-11,193,11,695,Closed,Article,"Arya Azar, Naser; Ghordoyee Milan, Sami; Kayhomayoon, Zahra","Arya Azar, Naser (Department of Water Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran); Ghordoyee Milan, Sami (Department of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, Aburaihan Campus, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran); Kayhomayoon, Zahra (Department of Geology, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran)","Ghordoyee Milan, Sami (University of Tehran)","Arya Azar, Naser (University of Tabriz); Ghordoyee Milan, Sami (University of Tehran); Kayhomayoon, Zahra (Payame Noor University)",7,7,0.96,3.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141687254,37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

However, predictive uncertainty, which consists of input uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and model uncertainty, is usually disregarded in deterministic data-driven modeling, and point estimates are separately presented. In this study, a probability-scheme combination ensemble prediction that employs quantile regression neural networks and kernel density estimation (QRNNs-KDE) is proposed for robust and accurate prediction and uncertainty quantification of landslide displacement. In the ensemble model, QRNNs serve as base learning algorithms to generate multiple base learners. Final ensemble prediction is obtained by integration of all base learners through a probability combination scheme based on KDE. The Fanjiaping landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) was selected as a case study to explore the performance of the ensemble prediction. Based on long-term (2006-2018) and near real-time monitoring data, a comprehensive analysis of the deformation characteristics was conducted for fully understanding the triggering factors. The experimental results indicate that the QRNNs-KDE approach can perform predictions with perfect performance and outperform the traditional backpropagation (BP), radial basis function (RBF), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) methods, bootstrap-extreme learning machine-artificial neural network (bootstrap-ELM-ANN), and Copula-kernel-based support vector machine quantile regression (Copula-KSVMQR).

Our physics-informed machine-learning workflow addresses the challenges to real-time reservoir management in unconventionals, namely the lack of data (i.e., the time-frame for which the wells have been producing), and the significant computational expense of high-fidelity modeling. We do this by applying the machine-learning paradigm of transfer learning, where we combine fast, but less accurate reduced-order models with slow, but accurate high-fidelity models. We use the Patzek model (Proc Natl Acad Sci 11:19731–19736, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313380110, 2013) as the reduced-order model to generate synthetic production data and supplement this data with synthetic production data obtained from high-fidelity discrete fracture network simulations of the site of interest. Our results demonstrate that training with low-fidelity models is not sufficient for accurate forecasting, but transfer learning is able to augment the knowledge and perform well once trained with the small set of results from the high-fidelity model. Such a physics-informed machine-learning (PIML) workflow, grounded in physics, is a viable candidate for real-time history matching and production forecasting in a fractured shale gas reservoir.","This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)—Office of Fossil Energy (FE) through its Oil and Natural Gas Research Storage Program as implemented by the National Energy Technology Laboratory.

In the current study, two approaches were adopted to predict shear sonic wave velocities (Vs) from several petrophysical well logs, including gamma ray (GR), density (RHOB), neutron (NPHI), and compressional sonic wave velocity (Vp). For this purpose, five intelligent models of random forest (RF), extra tree (ET), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and the integration of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with differential evolution (DE) and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) optimizers were implemented. In the first approach, the target was estimated based only on Vp, and the second scenario predicted Vs from the integration of Vp, GR, RHOB, and NPHI inputs. In each scenario, 8061 data points belonging to an oilfield located in the southwest of Iran were investigated. The ET model showed a lower average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE) compared to other models for both approaches. Considering the first approach in which the Vp was the only input, the obtained AAPRE values for RF, ET, GPR, ANFIS + DE, and ANFIS + ICA models are 1.54%, 1.34%, 1.54%, 1.56%, and 1.57%, respectively. In the second scenario, the achieved AAPRE values for RF, ET, GPR, ANFIS + DE, and ANFIS + ICA models are 1.25%, 1.03%, 1.16%, 1.63%, and 1.49%, respectively. The Williams plot proved the validity of both one-input and four-inputs ET model. Regarding the ET model constructed based on only one variable,Williams plot interestingly showed that all 8061 data points are valid data. Also, the outcome of the Leverage approach for the ET model designed with four inputs highlighted that there are only 240 “out of leverage” data sets. In addition, only 169 data are suspected. Also, the sensitivity analysis results typified that the Vp has a higher effect on the target parameter (Vs) than other implemented inputs. Overall, the second scenario demonstrated more satisfactory Vs predictions due to the lower obtained errors of its developed models. Finally, the two ET models with the linear regression model, which is of high interest to the industry, were applied to diagnose candidate layers along the formation for hydraulic fracturing. While the linear regression model fails to accurately trace variations of rock properties, the intelligent models successfully detect brittle intervals consistent with field measurements.",,,Scientific Reports,,"Artificial Intelligence; Fuzzy Logic; Linear Models; Neural Networks, Computer; Neutrons",2022-04-02,2022,2022-04-02,,12,1,5579,All OA; Gold,Article,"Safaei-Farouji, Majid; Hasannezhad, Meysam; Rahimzadeh Kivi, Iman; Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein","Safaei-Farouji, Majid (School of Geology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran); Hasannezhad, Meysam (Faculty of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering, Sahand University of Technology, Sahand New Town, Tabriz, Iran); Rahimzadeh Kivi, Iman (Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research, Spanish National Research Council (IDAEA-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain; Associated Unit: Hydrogeology Group (UPC-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain); Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran; College of Construction Engineering, Jilin University, 130600, Changchun, China)","Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman; Jilin University)","Safaei-Farouji, Majid (University of Tehran); Hasannezhad, Meysam (Sahand University of Technology); Rahimzadeh Kivi, Iman (Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research; Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya); Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman; Jilin University)",4,4,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08864-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146837239,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

A large number of freshwater lakes around the world show recurring harmful algal blooms, particularly cyanobacterial blooms, that affect public health and ecosystem integrity. Prediction, early detection, and monitoring of algal blooms are inevitable for the mitigation and management of their negative impacts on the environment and human beings. Remote sensing provides an effective tool for detecting and spatiotemporal monitoring of these events. Various remote sensing platforms, such as ground-based, spaceborne, airborne, and UAV-based, have been used for mounting sensors for data acquisition and real-time monitoring of algal blooms in a cost-effective manner. This paper presents an updated review of various remote sensing platforms, data types, and algorithms for detecting and monitoring algal blooms in freshwater lakes. Recent studies on remote sensing using sophisticated sensors mounted on UAV platforms have revolutionized the detection and monitoring of water quality. Image processing algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been improved recently and predicting algal blooms based on such methods will have a key role in mitigating the negative impacts of eutrophication in the future.",,"This study was supported by Companhia Riograndense de Saneamento – CORSAN, Porto Alegre, Brazil, and the Institute of Geosciences, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul -UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Brazil.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Humans; Lakes; Ecosystem; Remote Sensing Technology; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Harmful Algal Bloom,2023-01-16,2023,2023-01-16,2023-02,30,8,19602-19616,Closed,Article,"Rolim, Silvia Beatriz Alves; Veettil, Bijeesh Kozhikkodan; Vieiro, Antonio Pedro; Kessler, Anita Baldissera; Gonzatti, Clóvis","Rolim, Silvia Beatriz Alves (Programa de Pós-Graduação Em Sensoriamento Remoto, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande Do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Veettil, Bijeesh Kozhikkodan (Laboratory of Ecology and Environmental Management, Science and Technology Advanced Institute, Van Lang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Faculty of Applied Technology, School of Engineering and Technology, Van Lang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam); Vieiro, Antonio Pedro (Departamento de Mineralogia e Petrologia, Instituto de Geociências, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande Do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Kessler, Anita Baldissera (Departamento de Geodésia, Instituto de Geociências, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande Do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Gonzatti, Clóvis (Departamento de Mineralogia e Petrologia, Instituto de Geociências, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande Do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil)","Veettil, Bijeesh Kozhikkodan (Van Lang University; Van Lang University)","Rolim, Silvia Beatriz Alves (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Veettil, Bijeesh Kozhikkodan (Van Lang University; Van Lang University); Vieiro, Antonio Pedro (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Kessler, Anita Baldissera (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Gonzatti, Clóvis (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154556841,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,14 Life Below Water

This research aims to make up for this inadequacy. First, a surface water quality prediction case study including eight monitoring sites in China was introduced. Second, the ARIMA and ANN’s performance was compared statistically between 6912 Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) and 110,592 feedforward ANN with different model structures, based on the mean square error (MSE) distributions depicted by boxplots. In a statistical view, the ANN models obtained a significantly lower median value and a more concentrated distribution of validation MSEs, which indicated lighter overfitting and better generalization ability.

Identifying newborns at higher risk of developing shunt conversion may improve the management of these patients. This study aimed to develop a predictive algorithm for conversion of an Ommaya reservoir to a permanent shunt using artificial intelligence techniques and classical statistics.
METHODS: A database of 43 preterm patients weighing ≤1500 g with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (Papile grades III and IV with Levene ventricular index >4 mm above the 97th percentile) managed with an Ommaya reservoir at our institution between 2002 and 2017 was used to train a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Validation of results was done with cross-validation technique. Three scenarios were calculated: 1) considering all features regardless whether or not they are correlated with the output variable; 2) considering the features as predictors if they have a correlation >30% with the output variable; 3) considering the output of the previous analysis.
RESULTS: When considering the outputs of a previous multivariate analysis, the algorithm reached 86% of cross-validation accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of machine learning-based algorithms can help in early identification of patients with permanent need of a shunt. We present a predictive algorithm for a permanent shunt with an accuracy of 86%; accuracy of the algorithm can be improved with larger volume of data and previous analysis.","We acknowledge the Levendis working group (Rudolf Baeuer, Jesús Sanz Sánchez, Antonio García Sánchez, Damiano Tofanin, and Marco Dal Molin) and Dr. Juan José Beunza for their advice regarding this study.",,World Neurosurgery,,"Artificial Intelligence; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts; Humans; Hydrocephalus; Infant, Newborn; Machine Learning; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2022-03-06,2022,2022-03-06,2022-06,162,,e264-e272,Closed,Article,"Sáez-Alegre, Miguel; Martín, Rocío; Palpán, Alexis; Carceller, Fernando; Sáez-Alegre, Jesús; Servera, Guillermo; Bauer, Rudolf; García Feijoo, Pablo; Saceda, Javier","Sáez-Alegre, Miguel (Servicio De Neurocirugía, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.

Hence, this study used in-situ physicochemical parameters to the limited data on HM concentration in SW and GW. The site of the study was Marinduque Island Province in the Philippines, which experienced two mining disasters. Prediction model results showed that the SW models during the dry and wet seasons recorded a mean squared error (MSE) ranging from 6 × 10-7 to 0.070276. The GW models recorded a range from 5 × 10-8 to 0.045373, all of which were approaching the ideal MSE value of 0. Kling-Gupta efficiency values of developed models were all greater than 0.95. The developed neural network-particle swarm optimization (NN-PSO) models for SW and GW were compared to linear and support vector machine (SVM) models and previously published deterministic and artificial intelligence (AI) models. The findings indicated that the developed NN-PSO models are superior to the developed linear and SVM models, up to 1.60 and 1.40 times greater than the best model observed created by linear and SVM models for SW and GW, respectively. The developed models were also on par with previously published deterministic and AI-based models considering their prediction capability. Sensitivity analysis using Olden's connection weights approach showed that pH influenced the concentration of HM significantly. Established on the research findings, it can be stated that the NN-PSO is an effective and practical approach in the prediction of HM concentration in water resources that contributes a solution to the limited HM concentration monitored data.","This is to acknowledge the support–in–kind of Mapua University, Marinduque Local Government Units, and Marinduque State College.",,Toxics,,,2022-02-18,2022,2022-02-18,,10,2,95,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Jesus, Kevin Lawrence M.; Senoro, Delia B.; Dela Cruz, Jennifer C.; Chan, Eduardo B.","De Jesus, Kevin Lawrence M.

Based on the long-term fluctuation characteristics of the GWL and the time lag of triggering factors, a dynamic prediction model of the GWL based on the Maximum information coefficient (MIC) algorithm and the long-term short-term memory (LSTM) model was proposed. The Sifangbei landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) in China, wherein eight GWL monitoring sensors were installed in different locations, was taken as a case study. The monitoring data represented that the fluctuation of the GWL has a specific time lag concerning the accumulated rainfall (AR) and the reservoir water level (RWL). In addition, there were spatial differences in the fluctuation of the GWL, which was controlled by the elevation and the micro landform. From January 19, 2015, to March 6, 2017, the measured data were used to set up the predicted models. The MIC algorithm was adopted to calculate the lag time of the GWL, the RWL, and the AR. The LSTM model is a time series prediction algorithm that can transmit historical information. The Gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was used to seek the most suitable hyperparameter of the LSTM model under the specific prediction conditions. The single-factor GWO-LSTM model without considering triggering factors and the support vector machine regression (SVR) model were considered to compare the prediction results. The results indicate that the MIC-GWO-LSTM model reached the highest accuracy and improved the prediction accuracy by considering the factor selection process with the learner training process. The proposed MIC-GWO-LSTM model combines the advantages of each algorithm and effectively constructs the response relationship between the GWL fluctuation and triggering factors; it also provides a new exploration for the GWL prediction, monitoring, and early warning system in the TGRA.",We wish to thank the Geo-environmental monitoring office of Wanzhou District and Housing and the Nanjiang Hydrogeological Team of Chongqing Geology Exploring Bureau for their assistance.

Hoerzer et al. showed that a chaotic reservoir network (RN) can learn with exploration driven by external random noise and a sequential reward. In this paper, we demonstrate that a chaotic RN can learn without external noise because the output fluctuation originated from its internal chaotic dynamics functions as exploration. As learning progresses, the chaoticity decreases and the network can automatically switch from exploration mode to exploitation mode. Furthermore, the network can resume exploration when presented with a new situation. In addition, we found that even when the two parameters that influence the chaoticity are varied, learning performance always improves around the edge of chaos. From these results, we think that exploration is generated from internal chaotic dynamics, and exploitation appears in the process of forming attractors on the chaotic dynamics through learning. Consequently, exploration and exploitation are well-balanced around the edge of chaos, which leads to good learning performance.",The authors would like to thank Prof. Suetani for introducing us the work of Hoerzer et al. and useful discussions about this research.

This study proposes a novel ensemble (or hybrid) model, based on the combination of a Deep Learning algorithm, the Nonlinear AutoRegressive network with eXogenous inputs, and two Machine Learning algorithms, Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest, for the short-term streamflow forecasting, considering precipitation as the only exogenous input and a forecast horizon up to 7 days. A large regional study was performed, considering 18 watercourses throughout the United Kingdom, characterized by different catchment areas and flow regimes. In particular, the predictions obtained with the ensemble Machine Learning-Deep Learning model were compared with the ones achieved with simpler models based on an ensemble of both Machine Learning algorithms and on the only Deep Learning algorithm. The hybrid Machine Learning-Deep Learning model outperformed the simpler models, with values of R2 above 0.9 for several watercourses, with the greatest discrepancies for small basins, where high and non-uniform rainfall throughout the year makes the streamflow rate forecasting a challenging task. Furthermore, the hybrid Machine Learning-Deep Learning model has been shown to be less affected by reductions in performance as the forecasting horizon increases compared to the simpler models, leading to reliable predictions even for 7-day forecasts.","F.D.N. contributed to the data collection, to the development of forecast models and to the manuscript preparation; F.G. contributed to the conceptualization of the study, to the development of forecast models and to the manuscript preparation; G.d.M contributed to the administration of the research project and to the manuscript preparation.",,Scientific Reports,,,2023-04-29,2023,2023-04-29,,13,1,7036,All OA; Gold,Article,"Di Nunno, Fabio; de Marinis, Giovanni; Granata, Francesco","Di Nunno, Fabio (Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering (DICEM), University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Via Di Biasio, 43, 03043, Frosinone, Cassino, Italy); de Marinis, Giovanni (Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering (DICEM), University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Via Di Biasio, 43, 03043, Frosinone, Cassino, Italy); Granata, Francesco (Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering (DICEM), University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Via Di Biasio, 43, 03043, Frosinone, Cassino, Italy)","Granata, Francesco (University of Cassino and Southern Lazio)","Di Nunno, Fabio (University of Cassino and Southern Lazio); de Marinis, Giovanni (University of Cassino and Southern Lazio); Granata, Francesco (University of Cassino and Southern Lazio)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34316-3,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157643644,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 3707 Hydrology; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been widely used in different forecasting and prediction applications, including in the oil industry. The dendritic neural regression (DNR) model is an ANNs that has showed promising performance in time-series prediction. The DNR has the capability to deal with the nonlinear characteristics of historical data for time-series forecasting applications. However, it faces certain limitations in training and configuring its parameters. To this end, we utilized the power of metaheuristic optimization algorithms to boost the training process and optimize its parameters. A comprehensive evaluation is presented in this study with six MH optimization algorithms used for this purpose: whale optimization algorithm (WOA), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), sine-cosine algorithm (SCA), differential evolution (DE), and harmony search algorithm (HS). We used oil-production datasets for historical records of crude oil production from seven real-world oilfields (from Tahe oilfields, in China), provided by a local partner. Extensive evaluation experiments were carried out using several performance measures to study the validity of the DNR with MH optimization methods in time-series applications. The findings of this study have confirmed the applicability of MH with DNR. The applications of MH methods improved the performance of the original DNR.

Many studies have focused on evaluating and quantifying the concentrations of the optically active water quality parameters, for parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chla), cyanobacteria, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). For the optically inactive parameters, such as the permanganate index (CODMn), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and heavy metals, it is difficult to estimate the concentrations directly, and the traditional indirect estimation models cannot meet the accuracy requirements, especially in heavily polluted inland waters. In this study, 60 water samples were collected at a depth of 50 cm from the Guanhe River in China, at the same time as the airborne data acquisition. We also developed and investigated two deep learning based regression models-a pixel-based deep neural network regression (pixel_DNNR) model and a patch-based deep neural network regression (patch_DNNR) model-to estimate seven optically inactive water quality parameters. Compared with the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR) models, the deep learning based regression models can obtain a superior accuracy, especially the patch_DNNR model, which obtained a superior prediction accuracy for all parameters, with the prediction dataset coefficient of determination (Rp2) and the residual prediction deviation (RPD) values being greater than 0.6 and 1.6, respectively. In addition, thematic maps of the water quality classification results and water parameter concentrations were generated and the overall water quality and pollution sources were analyzed in the study area. The experimental results demonstrate that the deep learning based regression models show a good performance in the feature extraction and image understanding of high-dimensional data, and they provide us with a new approach for optically inactive inland water quality parameter estimation.",This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 41871337).,,Environmental Pollution,,Chlorophyll A; Deep Learning; Environmental Monitoring; Rivers; Water Quality,2021-06-06,2021,2021-06-06,2021-10,286,,117534,Closed,Article,"Niu, Chao; Tan, Kun; Jia, Xiuping; Wang, Xue","Niu, Chao (Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education), East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China.); Tan, Kun (Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education), East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China; NASG Key Laboratory of Land Environment and Disaster Monitoring, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, China.

With the continuous expansion of aquaculture scale and density, contemporary aquaculture methods have been forced to overproduce resulting in the accelerated imbalance rate of water environment, the frequent occurrence of fish diseases, and the decline of aquatic product quality. Moreover, due to the fact that the average age profile of agricultural workers in many parts of the world are on the higher side, fishery production will face the dilemma of shortage of labor, and aquaculture methods are in urgent need of change. Modern information technology has gradually penetrated into various fields of agriculture, and the concept of intelligent fish farm has also begun to take shape. The intelligent fish farm tries to deal with the precise work of increasing oxygen, optimizing feeding, reducing disease incidences, and accurately harvesting through the idea of “replacing human with machine,” so as to liberate the manpower completely and realize the green and sustainable aquaculture. This paper reviews the application of fishery intelligent equipment, IoT, edge computing, 5G, and artificial intelligence algorithms in modern aquaculture, and analyzes the existing problems and future development prospects. Meanwhile, based on different business requirements, the design frameworks for key functional modules in the construction of intelligent fish farm are proposed.",,This study was supported by the Shandong Key R&D Program (Grant no. 2019JZZY010703) and the Sino-British Cooperation Project (2017YFE0122100-1).,Aquaculture International,,,2021-09-13,2021,2021-09-13,2021-12,29,6,2681-2711,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Wang, Cong; Li, Zhen; Wang, Tan; Xu, Xianbao; Zhang, Xiaoshuan; Li, Daoliang","Wang, Cong (National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Internet of Things in Agriculture China Agriculture University, 100083, Beijing, China; College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural University, 100083, Beijing, China); Li, Zhen (National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Internet of Things in Agriculture China Agriculture University, 100083, Beijing, China; College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural University, 100083, Beijing, China); Wang, Tan (National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Internet of Things in Agriculture China Agriculture University, 100083, Beijing, China; College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural University, 100083, Beijing, China); Xu, Xianbao (National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Internet of Things in Agriculture China Agriculture University, 100083, Beijing, China; College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural University, 100083, Beijing, China); Zhang, Xiaoshuan (College of Engineering, China Agricultural University, 100083, Beijing, China); Li, Daoliang (National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Internet of Things in Agriculture China Agriculture University, 100083, Beijing, China; College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural University, 100083, Beijing, China)","Zhang, Xiaoshuan (China Agricultural University); Li, Daoliang (China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University)","Wang, Cong (China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University); Li, Zhen (China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University); Wang, Tan (China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University); Xu, Xianbao (China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University); Zhang, Xiaoshuan (China Agricultural University); Li, Daoliang (China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University)",31,31,0.55,21.5,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10499-021-00773-8.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141073274,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

Machine learning (ML) prediction models have been applied to predict ARGs in beach waters. However, the existing studies were conducted at a single location and had low prediction performance. Moreover, ML models are ""black boxes"" that do not reveal their predictions' internal nuances and mechanisms. This lack of transparency and trust can result in serious consequences when using these models in high-stakes decisions. In this study, we developed a gradient boosted regression tree based (GBRT) ML model and then described its behavior using six explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model-agnostic explanation methods. We used hydro-meteorological and qPCR data from the beaches in South Korea and Pakistan and developed ML prediction models for aac (6'-lb-cr), sul1, and tetX with 10-fold time-blocked cross-validation performances of 4.9, 2.06 and 4.4 root mean squared logarithmic error, respectively. We then analyzed the local and global behavior of the developed ML model using four interpretation methods. The developed ML models showed that water temperature, precipitation and tide are the most important predictors for prediction of ARGs at recreational beaches. We show that the model-agnostic interpretation methods not only explain the behavior of the ML model but also provide insights into the behavior of the ML model under new unseen conditions. Moreover, these post-processing techniques can be a debugging tool for ML-based modeling.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research work was funded by Institutional Fund Projects under grant no.

The available numerical equations for water saturation estimation are unreliable and depend on laboratory core analysis. Therefore, this paper attempts to use artificial intelligence methods in developing an artificial neural network model (ANN) for water saturation (Sw) prediction. The ANN model is developed and validated by using 2700 core measured points from the fields located in the Gulf of Suez, Nile Delta, and Western Desert of Egypt, with inputs including the formation depth, the caliper size, the sonic time, gamma rays (GRs), shallow resistivity (Rxo), neutron porosity (NPHI), the photoelectric effect (PEF), bulk density, and deep resistivity (Rt). The study results show that the optimization process for the ANN model is achieved by distributing the collected data as follows: 80% for training and 20% for testing processes, with an R 2 of 0.973 and a mean square error (MSE) of 0.048. In addition, a mathematical equation is extracted out of the ANN model that is used to estimate the formation water saturation in a simple and direct approach. The developed equation can be used incorporating with the existing well logs commercial software to increase the accuracy of water saturation prediction. A comparison study is executed using published correlations (Waxman and Smits, dual water, and effective models) to show the robustness of the presented ANN model and the extracted equation. The results show that the proposed correlation and the ANN model achieved outstanding performance and better accuracy than the existing empirical models for calculating the formation water saturation with a high correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.973, lowest mean-square error (MSE) of 0.048, lowest average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE) of 0.042, and standard deviation (SD) of 0.24. To the best of our knowledge, the current study and the proposed ANN model establish a novel base in the estimation of formation water saturation.",The authors would like to thank American University of Kurdistan for providing the laboratory and computational facilities.,,ACS Omega,,,2022-08-16,2022,2022-08-16,2022-08-30,7,34,29666-29674,All OA; Gold,Article,"Azim, Reda Abdel; Hamada, Ghareb","Azim, Reda Abdel (Petroleum Engineering Department, American University of Kurdistan, Duhok, 40025, Kurdistan Region of Iraq); Hamada, Ghareb (Petroleum Engineering Department, American University of Kurdistan, Duhok, 40025, Kurdistan Region of Iraq)","Azim, Reda Abdel ; Hamada, Ghareb ","Azim, Reda Abdel (); Hamada, Ghareb ()",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c01945,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150269236,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Therefore, various methods with distinct efficiency for the evaluation of permeability have been proposed by engineers and petroleum geologists. The oil industry uses acoustic and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) loggings extensively to determine permeability quantitatively. However, because the number of available NMR logs is not enough and there is a significant difficulty in their interpreting and evaluation, the use of acoustic logs to determine the permeability has become very important. Direct, continuous, and in-reservoir condition estimation of permeability is a unique feature of the Stoneley waves analysis as an acoustic technique. In this study, five intelligent mathematical methods, including Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), and Committee Machine Intelligent System (CMIS), have been performed for calculating permeability in terms of Stoneley and shear waves travel-time, effective porosity, bulk density and lithological data in one of the naturally-fractured and low-porosity carbonate reservoirs located in the Southwest of Iran. Intelligent models have been improved with three popular optimization algorithms, including Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Among the developed models, the CMIS is the most accurate intelligent model for permeability forecast as compared to the core permeability data with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.87 and an average absolute deviation (AAD) of 3.7. Comparing the CMIS method with the NMR techniques (i.e., Timur-Coates and Schlumberger-Doll-Research (SDR)), the superiority of the Stoneley method is demonstrated. With this model, diverse types of fractures in carbonate formations can be easily identified. As a result, it can be claimed that the models presented in this study are of great value to petrophysicists and petroleum engineers working on reservoir simulation and well completion.",,,Scientific Reports,,"Carbonates; Neural Networks, Computer; Oil and Gas Fields; Permeability; Petroleum",2022-07-08,2022,2022-07-08,,12,1,11618,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rostami, Alireza; Kordavani, Ali; Parchekhari, Shahin; Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein; Helalizadeh, Abbas","Rostami, Alireza (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Petroleum University of Technology (PUT), Ahwaz, Iran); Kordavani, Ali (Department of Petrophysics Engineering, National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC), Ahwaz, Iran); Parchekhari, Shahin (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Kish International Campus, University of Tehran, Kish, Iran); Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran; Key Laboratory of Continental Shale Hydrocarbon Accumulation and Efficient Development, Ministry of Education, Northeast Petroleum University, 163318, Daqing, China); Helalizadeh, Abbas (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Petroleum University of Technology (PUT), Ahwaz, Iran)","Rostami, Alireza (Petroleum University of Technology); Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman; Northeast Petroleum University)","Rostami, Alireza (Petroleum University of Technology); Kordavani, Ali (); Parchekhari, Shahin (University of Tehran); Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman; Northeast Petroleum University); Helalizadeh, Abbas (Petroleum University of Technology)",2,2,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15869-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149326803,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

As a consequence of this, there is a need for a model that can make accurate projections about water quality. This work shows the comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Ada Boost, used for the water quality classification. The model is trained on the Water Quality Index dataset available on Kaggle. Z-score is used to normalize the dataset before beginning the training process for the model. Because the given dataset is unbalanced, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to balance the dataset. Experiments results depict that Random Forest and Gradient Boost give the highest accuracy of 81%. One of the major issues with the machine learning model is lack of transparency which makes it impossible to evaluate the results of the model.

However, most of the existing research has ignored the frequency component of inducing factors and how it affects the landslide deformation. Therefore, a hybrid displacement prediction model based on time series theory and various intelligent algorithms was proposed in this paper to study the effect of frequency components. Firstly, the monitoring displacement of landslide from the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) was decomposed into the trend and periodic components by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). The trend component can be predicted by the least square method. Then, time series of inducing factors like rainfall and reservoir level was reconstructed into high frequency components and low frequency components with CEEMD and t-test, respectively. The dominant factors were selected by the method of dynamic time warping (DTW) from the frequency components and other common factors (e.g., current monthly rainfall). Finally, the ant colony optimization-based support vector machine regression (ACO-SVR) is utilized for prediction purposes in the TGRA. The results demonstrate that after considering the frequency components of landslide-induced factors, the accuracy of the displacement prediction model based on ACO-SVR is better than that of other models based on SVR and GA-SVR.",The authors would like to gratefully appreciate the editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive criticism and comments on the earlier version of this paper and offering valuable suggestions that help to improve this paper.,"This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFC1501305), the National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Projects of China (No. 41827808), the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 41702328, 41702328, 41807263, the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2019CFB585). the Science and Technology Research Project of Hubei Education Department (D2019038), the Open Foundation of Top Disciplines in Yangtze University.",Sensors,,,2020-07-31,2020,2020-07-31,,20,15,4287,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Junrong; Tang, Huiming; Wen, Tao; Ma, Junwei; Tan, Qinwen; Xia, Ding; Liu, Xiao; Zhang, Yongquan","Zhang, Junrong (Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China;, zjr@cug.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, tanghm@cug.edu.cn, (H.T.);, tanqinwen@cug.edu.cn, (Q.T.);, cug_xia@cug.edu.cn, (D.X.)); Tang, Huiming (Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China;, zjr@cug.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, tanghm@cug.edu.cn, (H.T.);, tanqinwen@cug.edu.cn, (Q.T.);, cug_xia@cug.edu.cn, (D.X.)); Wen, Tao (School of Geosciences, Yangtze University, Wuhan 430100, Hubei, China;, wentao200840@yangtzeu.edu.cn); Ma, Junwei (Three Gorges Research Center for Geohazards of Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China;, majw@cug.edu.cn, (J.M.);, liuxiao@cug.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Tan, Qinwen (Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China;, zjr@cug.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, tanghm@cug.edu.cn, (H.T.);, tanqinwen@cug.edu.cn, (Q.T.);, cug_xia@cug.edu.cn, (D.X.)); Xia, Ding (Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China;, zjr@cug.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, tanghm@cug.edu.cn, (H.T.);, tanqinwen@cug.edu.cn, (Q.T.);, cug_xia@cug.edu.cn, (D.X.)); Liu, Xiao (Three Gorges Research Center for Geohazards of Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China;, majw@cug.edu.cn, (J.M.);, liuxiao@cug.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Zhang, Yongquan (Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China;, zjr@cug.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, tanghm@cug.edu.cn, (H.T.);, tanqinwen@cug.edu.cn, (Q.T.);, cug_xia@cug.edu.cn, (D.X.))","Zhang, Yongquan (China University of Geosciences)","Zhang, Junrong (China University of Geosciences); Tang, Huiming (China University of Geosciences); Wen, Tao (Yangtze University); Ma, Junwei (China University of Geosciences); Tan, Qinwen (China University of Geosciences); Xia, Ding (China University of Geosciences); Liu, Xiao (China University of Geosciences); Zhang, Yongquan (China University of Geosciences)",25,24,0.73,9.91,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/15/4287/pdf?version=1596438425,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129864010,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Traditionally, these two techniques have largely been treated as independent methodologies in practical applications. This study develops an optimized ensemble deep learning framework wherein these two machine learning techniques are jointly used to achieve synergistic improvements in model accuracy, stability, scalability, and reproducibility, prompting a new wave of applications in the forecasting of dynamics. Unpredictability is considered one of the key features of chaotic dynamics; therefore, forecasting such dynamics of nonlinear systems is a relevant issue in the scientific community. It becomes more challenging when the prediction of extreme events is the focus issue for us. In this circumstance, the proposed optimized ensemble deep learning (OEDL) model based on a best convex combination of feed-forward neural networks, reservoir computing, and long short-term memory can play a key role in advancing predictions of dynamics consisting of extreme events. The combined framework can generate the best out-of-sample performance than the individual deep learners and standard ensemble framework for both numerically simulated and real-world data sets. We exhibit the outstanding performance of the OEDL framework for forecasting extreme events generated from a Liénard-type system, prediction of COVID-19 cases in Brazil, dengue cases in San Juan, and sea surface temperature in the Niño 3.4 region.","The authors would like to thank Chittaranjan Hens, Arindam Mishra, and Subrata Ghosh for constructive discussions and notable comments.",,Chaos An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science,,"COVID-19; Deep Learning; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Reproducibility of Results; SARS-CoV-2",2021-11,2021,,2021-11,31,11,111105,All OA; Green,Article,"Ray, Arnob; Chakraborty, Tanujit; Ghosh, Dibakar","Ray, Arnob (Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata 700108, India); Chakraborty, Tanujit (Department of Science and Engineering, Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE); Ghosh, Dibakar (Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata 700108, India)","Ghosh, Dibakar (Indian Statistical Institute)","Ray, Arnob (Indian Statistical Institute); Chakraborty, Tanujit (Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi); Ghosh, Dibakar (Indian Statistical Institute)",14,14,2.81,15.99,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08968,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142718900,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,3 Good Health and Well Being

          Purpose
          Machine learning (ML) applications in predictive models in neuro-oncology have become an increasingly investigated subject of research. For their incorporation into clinical practice, rigorous assessment is needed to reduce bias. Several reports have indicated utility of ML applications in differentiation of glioma from brain metastasis. However, a systematic assessment of quality of methodology and reporting in these studies has not been done yet. We examined the adherence of 29 published reports in this field to the TRIPOD statement, which is similar to CLAIM checklist.


          Materials and Methods
          Our systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane trials (CENTRAL) and Web of science core-collection were searched. Keywords included artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, radiomics, magnetic resonance imaging, glioma, and glioblastoma. Assessment of TRIPOD adherence in 29 eligible studies was performed. Individual item performance was assessed by adherence index (ADI), the ratio of mean achieved score to maximum score per TRIPOD item.


          Results
          In a preliminary analysis of 8 studies, the average TRIPOD adherence score was 0.48 (14.25/30 items fulfilled) with individual scores ranging from 0.27 (8/30) to 0.60 (18/30). Best overall item performance, with an ADI of 1, was seen in item 3 (Background/Objectives), 16 (Model performance) and 19 (Interpretation). Poorest performance was detected in item 1 (Title) and 2 (Abstract), followed by item 9 (Missing Data) with ADI of 0, 0 and 0.13, respectively.


          Conclusion
          Preliminary results underline the lack of reproducibility in ML studies on distinction between glioma and brain metastasis. An average TRIPOD adherence score of 0.48 indicates insufficient quality of reporting and outlines the need for increased utilization of quality scoring systems in study documentation. Systematic evaluation of quality score adherence will allow us to identify common flaws in this field for enabling translation of models into clinical workflow.",,,Neuro-Oncology Advances,,,2021-08-09,2021,2021-08-09,2021-08-09,3,Suppl 3,iii17-iii18,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jekel, Leon; Brim, Waverly Rose; Petersen, Gabriel Cassinelli; Subramanian, Harry; Zeevi, Tal; Payabvash, Seyedmehdi; Bousabarah, Khaled; Lin, MingDe; Cui, Jin; Brackett, Alexandria; Johnson, Michele; Malhotra, Ajay; Aboian, Mariam","Jekel, Leon (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Brim, Waverly Rose (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Petersen, Gabriel Cassinelli (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Subramanian, Harry (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Zeevi, Tal (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Payabvash, Seyedmehdi (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Bousabarah, Khaled (Visage Imaging GmbH, Berlin, Germany); Lin, MingDe (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Cui, Jin (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Brackett, Alexandria (Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA); Johnson, Michele (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Malhotra, Ajay (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA); Aboian, Mariam (Brain Tumor Research Group, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA)",,"Jekel, Leon (Yale University); Brim, Waverly Rose (Yale University); Petersen, Gabriel Cassinelli (Yale University); Subramanian, Harry (Yale University); Zeevi, Tal (Yale University); Payabvash, Seyedmehdi (Yale University); Bousabarah, Khaled (); Lin, MingDe (Yale University); Cui, Jin (Yale University); Brackett, Alexandria (Yale University); Johnson, Michele (Yale University); Malhotra, Ajay (Yale University); Aboian, Mariam (Yale University)",2,2,,1.58,https://academic.oup.com/noa/article-pdf/3/Supplement_3/iii17/39606671/vdab071.070.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140286843,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this review article, we illustrate how Machine Learning (ML) could support more sustainable development, covering the basics of data gathering through each step of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA). The literature provides several examples showing how ML can be employed in most steps of a typical ERA.A key observation is that there are currently no clear guidance for using such autonomous technologies in ERAs or which standards/checks are required. Steering thus seems to be the most important task for supporting the use of ML in the ERA of nano- and smart-materials. Resources should be devoted to developing a strategy for implementing ML in ERA with a strong emphasis on data foundations, methodologies, and the related sensitivities/uncertainties.

In such a context, modern frameworks are not only limited to the system telemetry but also include the detection of potentially harmful conditions. However, when the number of signals generated by a system is large, it becomes challenging to properly correlate the information for an effective diagnosis. The combination of Artificial Intelligence and sensor data fusion techniques is a valid solution to address this problem, implementing models capable of extracting information from a set of heterogeneous sources. On the other hand, the constrained resources of Edge devices, where these algorithms are usually executed, pose strict limitations in terms of memory occupation and models complexity. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose an Echo State Network architecture which exploits sensor data fusion to detect the faults on a scale replica industrial plant. Thanks to its sparse weights structure, Echo State Networks are Recurrent Neural Networks models, which exhibit a low complexity and memory footprint, which makes them suitable to be deployed on an Edge device. Through the analysis of vibration and current signals, the proposed model is able to correctly detect the majority of the faults occurring in the industrial plant. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and present a comparison with other approaches, where we show that our methodology is the best trade-off in terms of precision, recall, F1-score and inference time.",,,Sensors,,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Industry; Neural Networks, Computer",2022-04-08,2022,2022-04-08,,22,8,2858,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bruneo, Dario; De Vita, Fabrizio","Bruneo, Dario (Department of Engineering, University of Messina, 98166 Messina, Italy.); De Vita, Fabrizio (Department of Engineering, University of Messina, 98166 Messina, Italy.)","Bruneo, Dario (University of Messina)","Bruneo, Dario (University of Messina); De Vita, Fabrizio (University of Messina)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/2858/pdf?version=1649406014,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147014514,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

To ensure stability and echo state property in the reservoir, Recurrent Plots (RPs) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) techniques are exploited for explainability and characterization of the reservoir dynamics and hence tuning ESN hyperparameters. The optimized self-organizing reservoirs are cascaded with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to ensure that the activation of internal echo state representations (ESRs) echoes similar topological qualities and temporal features of the input time-series, and the CNN efficiently learns the dynamics and multiscale temporal features from the ESRs for action recognition. The hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms are additionally adopted to optimize the CNN stage in SO-ConvESN. Experimental results on the HAR problem using several publicly available 3D-skeleton-based action datasets demonstrate the showcasing of the RPs and RQA technique in examining the explainability of reservoir dynamics for designing stable self-organizing reservoirs and the usefulness of implementing HPOs in SO-ConvESN for the HAR task.

Although many researches have been conducted on solubility of gases in brine and water, very few researches investigated the solubility of power plant flue gases (CO2–N2 mixtures) in aqueous solutions. In this study, using six intelligent models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting-Decision Tree (GB-DT), Adaptive Boosting-Decision Tree (AdaBoost-DT), Adaptive Boosting-Support Vector Regression (AdaBoost-SVR), and Gradient Boosting-Support Vector Regression (GB-SVR), the solubility of CO2–N2 mixtures in water and brine solutions was predicted, and the results were compared with four equations of state (EOSs), including Peng–Robinson (PR), Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK), Valderrama–Patel–Teja (VPT), and Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT). The results indicate that the Random Forest model with an average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE) value of 2.8% has the best predictions. The GB-SVR and DT models also have good precision with AAPRE values of 6.43% and 7.41%, respectively. For solubility of CO2 present in gaseous mixtures in aqueous systems, the PC-SAFT model, and for solubility of N2, the VPT EOS had the best results among the EOSs. Also, the sensitivity analysis of input parameters showed that increasing the mole percent of CO2 in gaseous phase, temperature, pressure, and decreasing the ionic strength increase the solubility of CO2–N2 mixture in water and brine solutions. Another significant issue is that increasing the salinity of brine also has a subtractive effect on the solubility of CO2–N2 mixture. Finally, the Leverage method proved that the actual data are of excellent quality and the Random Forest approach is quite reliable for determining the solubility of the CO2–N2 gas mixtures in aqueous systems.",Fahimeh Hadavimoghaddam would like to acknowledge the support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under agreement No. 075-15-2020-900 within the framework of the development program for a world-class Research Center.,,Scientific Reports,,Artificial Intelligence; Carbon Dioxide; Gases; Solubility; Water,2022-03-07,2022,2022-03-07,,12,1,3625,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nakhaei-Kohani, Reza; Taslimi-Renani, Ehsan; Hadavimoghaddam, Fahime; Mohammadi, Mohammad-Reza; Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein","Nakhaei-Kohani, Reza (Department of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran); Taslimi-Renani, Ehsan (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya (UM), 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); Hadavimoghaddam, Fahime (Ufa State Petroleum Technological University, 450064, Ufa, Russia; Institute of Unconventional Oil & Gas, Northeast Petroleum University, 163318, Heilongjiang, Daqing, China); Mohammadi, Mohammad-Reza (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran); Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran; Key Laboratory of Continental Shale Hydrocarbon Accumulation and Efficient Development, Ministry of Education, Northeast Petroleum University, 163318, Daqing, China)","Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman; Northeast Petroleum University)","Nakhaei-Kohani, Reza (Shiraz University); Taslimi-Renani, Ehsan (University of Malaya); Hadavimoghaddam, Fahime (Ufa State Petroleum Technological University; Northeast Petroleum University); Mohammadi, Mohammad-Reza (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman); Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein (Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman; Northeast Petroleum University)",11,11,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07393-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146090000,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

The purpose of this study is to predict the LS distribution by generating land subsidence susceptibility models (LSSMs) for the Shahroud plain in Iran using three different multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and five different artificial intelligence (AI) models. The MCDM models we used are the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija IKompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS), and the AI models are the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Cubist, Elasticnet, Bayesian multivariate adaptive regression spline (BMARS) and conditional random forest (Cforest) methods. We used the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, Area Under Curve (AUC) and different statistical indices,i.e. accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F score, Kappa, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Criteria (NSC)to validate and evaluate the methods. Based on the different validation techniques, the Cforest method yielded the best results with minimum and maximum values of 0.04 and 0.99, respectively. According to the Cforest model, 30.55% of the study area is extremely vulnerable to land subsidence. The results of our research will be of great help to planners and policy makers in the identification of the most vulnerable regions and the implementation of appropriate development strategies in this area.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,Journal of Environmental Management,,Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Iran; ROC Curve,2021-02-05,2021,2021-02-05,2021-04,284,,112067,Closed,Article,"Arabameri, Alireza; Chandra Pal, Subodh; Rezaie, Fatemeh; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Chowdhuri, Indrajit; Blaschke, Thomas; Thi Ngo, Phuong Thao","Arabameri, Alireza (Department of Geomorphology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, 14117-13116, Iran.

Despite the less contraction and spread of COVID-19 in Africa compared to some other continents in the world, Africa remains amongst the most vulnerable regions due to less technology and unequipped or poor health system. Recent happenings showed that COVID-19 may stay for years owing to the discoveries of new variants (such as Omicron) and new wave of infections in several countries. Therefore, accurate prediction of new cases is vital to make informed decisions and in evaluating the measures that should be implemented. Studies on COVID-19 prediction are limited in Africa despite the risks and dangers that the virus possessed. Hence, this study was performed to predict daily COVID-19 cases in 10 African countries spread across the north, south, east, west and central Africa considering countries with few and large number of daily COVID-19 cases. Machine learning (ML) models due to their nonlinearity and accurate prediction capabilities were employed for this purpose, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) and conventional multiple linear regression (MLR) models. As any other natural process, the COVID-19 pandemic may contain both linear and nonlinear aspects. In such circumstances, neither nonlinear (ML) nor linear (MLR) models could be sufficient; hence, combining both ML and MLR models may produce better accuracy. Consequently, to improve the prediction efficiency of the ML models, novel ensemble approaches including ANN-E and SVM-E were employed. The advantage of using ensemble approaches is that they provide collective benefits of all the standalone models, thereby reducing their weaknesses and enhancing their prediction capabilities. The obtained results showed that ANFIS led to better prediction performance with MAD = 0.0106, MSE = 0.0003, RMSE = 0.0185 and R2 = 0.9059 in the validation step. The results of the proposed ensemble approaches demonstrated very high improvements in predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa with MAD = 0.0073, MSE = 0.0002, RMSE = 0.0155 and R2 = 0.9616. The ANN-E improved the standalone models performance in the validation step up to 10%, 14%, 42%, 6%, 83%, 11%, 7%, 5%, 7% and 31% for Morocco, Sudan, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda, Rwanda, Nigeria, Senegal, Gabon and Cameroon, respectively.

Educational technology is not only a subject but also a career adapted to education and teaching. The growth speed of modern educational technology and the size of its benefits determine its management level to a large extent. With new technologies, new ideas, and new social needs, it is difficult for new ideas, new thoughts, and new methods to make the traditional e-learning management to accommodate the demands of the new era. At present, the work efficiency of modern educational technology visualization systems is generally not high, and modern distance teaching has an increasing demand for management informatization. However, there is a lack of a management platform for distance education that adapts to organizational characteristics such as openness, dynamics, flexibility, individualization, and decentralization. Therefore, this study introduces machine learning and BP neural network, establishes a visual modern distance teaching management system model, and uses machine learning algorithms to learn the visual process. The experimental results show that the system efficiency after learning is higher, and the time required for visualization of different groups in the experiment is 14.32 s, 13.18 s, 12.27 s, and 13.64 s, respectively, which effectively improves the efficiency of visualization and reduces the consumption of human resources.","This research study was sponsored by Jiangxi Province, College of Humanities and Social Science Research Projects, “The Formation Logic, Connotation Characteristics, and Practical Rationale of Social Identity of Vocational Undergraduate, under JY21114.

Colombia is a country that has been greatly affected by this disaster. For example, in the years 2010 and 2011 there was a heavy rainy season, which caused floods that affected at least two million people and there were economic losses of 6.5 million dollars, which is equivalent to 5.7% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at that time. The Magdalena River is the most important since 128 municipalities and 43 cities with a population of 6.3 million people, which is 13% of the total population of the country, are located in its basins. For this reason, the objective of the research is to design and implement a model that helps predict flooding over the Magdalena River by examining three techniques of artificial intelligence (Artificial Neuronal Networks, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System, Support Vector Machine), and thus determining which of these techniques are the most effective according to the case study. The research was limited only to these three types, due to limitations of time, data, human and financial resources, and technological infrastructure. In the end, it is concluded that the Artificial Neural Networks technique is a suitable option to implement the predictive system as long as it is not very complex and does not require high processing machine. However, to establish a model based on rules to achieve a better interpretability of the floods, the ANFIS model can be used.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,2020-09-14,2020,2020-09-14,2020-09,6,9,e04872,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moreno, Jenny Marcela; Sánchez, Juan Manuel; Espitia, Helbert Eduardo","Moreno, Jenny Marcela (Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Bogotá, Colombia); Sánchez, Juan Manuel (Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Bogotá, Colombia); Espitia, Helbert Eduardo (Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Bogotá, Colombia)","Sánchez, Juan Manuel (District University of Bogotá)","Moreno, Jenny Marcela (District University of Bogotá); Sánchez, Juan Manuel (District University of Bogotá); Espitia, Helbert Eduardo (District University of Bogotá)",8,8,0.44,3.79,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844020317151/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130821369,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

However, when tackling the problem of multidimensional chaotic time series prediction, due to the randomly generated rules for input and reservoir weights, not only the representation of valuable variables is enriched but also redundant and irrelevant information is accumulated inevitably. To remove the redundant components, reduce the approximate collinearity among echo-state information, and improve the generalization and stability, a new method called hierarchical ESN with sparse learning (HESN-SL) is proposed. The HESN-SL mines and captures the latent evolution patterns hidden from the dynamic system by means of layer-by-layer processing in stacked reservoirs, and leverage monotone accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to train a sparse output layer with variable selection capability. Meanwhile, we further prove that the HESN-SL satisfies the echo state property, which guarantees the stability and convergence of the proposed model when applied to time series prediction.

Many studies have been conducted on different sets of steam flooding projects using the conventional data analysis methods, while the implementation of machine learning algorithms to find the hidden patterns is rarely found. In this study, a hierarchical clustering algorithm (HCA) coupled with principal component analysis is used to analyze the steam flooding projects worldwide. The goal of this research is to group similar steam flooding projects into the same cluster so that valuable operational design experiences and production performance from the analogue cases can be referenced for decision-making. Besides, hidden patterns embedded in steam flooding applications can be revealed based on data characteristics of each cluster for different reservoir/fluid conditions. In this research, principal component analysis is applied to project original data to a new feature space, which finds two principal components to represent the eight reservoir/fluid parameters (8D) but still retain about 90% of the variance. HCA is implemented with the optimized design of five clusters, Euclidean distance, and Ward's linkage method. The results of the hierarchical clustering depict that each cluster detects a unique range of each property, and the analogue cases present that fields under similar reservoir/fluid conditions could share similar operational design and production performance.","This research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (grant ZR2021QF076), Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational “Youth Innovation Science and Technology Plan” (grant 2021KJ060), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 52174121 and 71971130).",,ACS Omega,,,2022-05-25,2022,2022-05-25,2022-06-07,7,22,18804-18815,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Na; Wei, Mingzhen; Bai, Baojun; Wang, Xiaopeng; Hao, Jian; Jia, Shun","Zhang, Na (Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China; Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, 65401, United States); Wei, Mingzhen (Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, 65401, United States); Bai, Baojun (Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, 65401, United States); Wang, Xiaopeng (Changqing Oilfield Branch of PetroChina, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710200, China); Hao, Jian (Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China); Jia, Shun (Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China)","Zhang, Na (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Missouri University of Science and Technology); Wei, Mingzhen (Missouri University of Science and Technology)","Zhang, Na (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Missouri University of Science and Technology); Wei, Mingzhen (Missouri University of Science and Technology); Bai, Baojun (Missouri University of Science and Technology); Wang, Xiaopeng (); Hao, Jian (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Jia, Shun (Shandong University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c01693,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148157288,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

In particular, accurate prediction of river flow during massive flood events and capturing the hysteretic behavior of river stage-discharge are among the key interests in hydrological research. The literature demonstrates that data-driven models are significant in identifying complex and hidden relationships among dependent variables, without considering explicit physical schemes. In this regard, we aim to discover the extent to which data-driven models can recognize the hidden relationships among different hydrological variables, in order to generate accurate predictions of the river flow. A secondary aim involves the detection of whether data-driven models can digest the internal features of training inputs to extrapolate severe flood records beyond the training domain. To achieve these aims, we developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of two hidden layers to capture the hidden relationships among the inputs, and investigated the model’s predictive capability using quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis comprised of a comparison between model predictions, and another set of precise independent records obtained through an advanced hydroacoustic system for reference. A qualitative approach was adopted to visualize the hysteretic behavior of the stage-discharge relations of the model records, with the high-resolution records of the hydroacoustic system. The findings display the potential of data-driven models for accurately predicting river flow. Consequently, the qualitative analysis revealed moderate correlations of stage-discharge loops as compared to the reference records.

Understanding the dynamics of water quality in any water body is vital for the sustainability of our water resources. Thus, investigating spatio-temporal changes of dominant water quality parameters (WQPs) in any study is indeed critical for proposing the appropriate treatment for the water bodies. Traditionally, concentrations of WQPs have been measured through intensive fieldwork. Additionally, many studies have attempted to retrieve concentrations of WQPs from satellite images using regression-based methods. However, the relationship between WQPs and satellite data is complex to be modeled accurately by using simple regression-based methods. Our study attempts to develop a machine learning model for mapping the concentrations of dominant optical and non-optical WQPs such as electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature (Temp), total dissolved solids (TDS), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and dissolved oxygen (DO). In this context, a remote sensing framework based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor with optimized hyper parameters (HPs) to quantify concentrations of different WQPs from the Landsat-8 satellite imagery is developed. We evaluated six years of satellite data stretching spatially from upstream to downstream Ankinghat to Chopan (20 stations under Central Water Commission (CWC), Middle Ganga Basin) for characterizing the trends of dominant physico-chemical WQPs across the four clusters identified in our previous study. Through the developed XGBoost and MLP regression models between measured WQPs and the reflectance of the pixels corresponding to the sampling stations, a significant coefficient of determination (R2) in the range of 0.88–0.98 for XGBoost and 0.72–0.97 for MLP were generated, with bands B1–B4 and their ratios more consistent. Indeed, these findings indicate that from a small number of in-situ measurements, we can develop reliable models to estimate the spatio-temporal variations of physico-chemical and biological WQPs. Therefore, models generated from Landsat-8 could facilitate the environmental, economic, and social management of any waterbody.",The Landsat images are downloaded from http://www.earthexplorer.usgs.gov.

However, these studies have been limited to monitor the vertical distribution of HABs due to the optical complexity of inland water. Therefore, this study applied a deep neural network model to monitor the vertical distribution of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), phycocyanin (PC), and turbidity (Turb) using drone-borne hyperspectral imagery, in-situ measurement, and meteoroidal data. The pigment concentrations were measured between depths of 0 m and 5.0 m with 0.05 m intervals. Here, four state-of-the-art data-driven model structures (ResNet-18, ResNet-101, GoogLeNet, and Inception v3) were adopted for estimating the vertical distributions of the harmful algal pigments. Among the four models, the ResNet-18 model showed the best performance, with an R2 value of 0.70. In addition, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) substantially provided informative reflectance band ranges near 490 nm and 620 nm in the hyperspectral image for the vertical estimation of pigments. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the explainable deep learning model with drone-borne hyperspectral images has the potential to estimate Chl-a, PC, and Turb vertical distributions and to show influential features that contribute to describing the vertical profile phenomena.","This work was supported by the ICT RD program of MSIT/IITP (2018-0-00219, Space-time complex artificial intelligence blue-green algae prediction technology based on direct-readable water quality complex sensor and hyperspectral image), and the Korea Environment Industry Technology Institute (KEITI) through Aquatic Ecosystem Conservation Research Program, funded by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) (2020003030003).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Deep Learning; Environmental Monitoring; Harmful Algal Bloom; Phycocyanin,2021-06-19,2021,2021-06-19,2021-11,794,,148592,Closed,Article,"Hong, Seok Min; Baek, Sang-Soo; Yun, Daeun; Kwon, Yong-Hwan; Duan, Hongtao; Pyo, JongCheol; Cho, Kyung Hwa","Hong, Seok Min (School of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 689-798, Republic of Korea.); Baek, Sang-Soo (School of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 689-798, Republic of Korea.); Yun, Daeun (School of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 689-798, Republic of Korea.); Kwon, Yong-Hwan (Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute, 218 Gajeong-ro, Yeseong-gu, Daejeon 305-700, Republic of Korea.); Duan, Hongtao (Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China.); Pyo, JongCheol (Center for Environmental Data Strategy, Korea Environment Institute, Sejong 30147, Republic of Korea.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has exhibited its practicability, reliability, and high efficiency in numerous applications; furthermore, it has solved conventional and emerging problems in both natural and engineered water systems. For example, ML can predict various water quality indicators in situ and real-time by considering the complex interactions among water-related variables. ML approaches can also solve emerging pollution problems with proven rules or universal mechanisms summarized from the related research. Moreover, by applying image recognition technology to analyze the relationships between image information and physicochemical properties of the research object, ML can effectively identify and characterize specific contaminants. In view of the bright prospects of ML, this review comprehensively summarizes the development of ML applications in natural and engineered water systems. First, the concept and modeling steps of ML are briefly introduced, including data preparation, algorithm selection and model evaluation. In addition, comprehensive applications of ML in recent studies, including predicting water quality, mapping groundwater contaminants, classifying water resources, tracing contaminant sources, and evaluating pollutant toxicity in natural water systems, as well as modeling treatment techniques, assisting characterization analysis, purifying and distributing drinking water, and collecting and treating sewage water in engineered water systems, are summarized. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used algorithms are analyzed according to their structures and mechanisms, and recommendations on the selection of ML algorithms for different studies, as well as prospects on the application and development of ML in water science are proposed.

Diagnosing this infection with minimal false rates is still an issue even with the advent of multiple rapid antigen tests. Enormous data are being collected every day that could provide insight into reducing the false diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) could be the way forward to process these data and reduce the false diagnosis rates. In this study, ML and DL approaches have been applied to the data set collected using an ultra-fast COVID-19 diagnostic sensor (UFC-19).

UFC-19 is an electrochemical sensor that was used to test these virus samples and the obtained current response dataset was used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 using different algorithms. Our results indicate that the convolution neural networks algorithm could diagnose SARS-CoV-2 samples with a sensitivity of 96.15%, specificity of 98.17%, and accuracy of 97.20%.

In this study, the water quality trend in the Yangtze River is found to stabilize at most monitoring stations under environmental protection activities. Based on the physical mechanism and stochastic theory, a novel river water quality prediction model combining pollution source decomposition (including local point, local nonpoint and upstream sources) and time series decomposition (including trend, seasonal and residential components) is developed. The observed water quality data from 76 monitoring stations in the Yangtze River, including permanganate index (CODMn) and total phosphorus (TP), are used to drive this model to make long-term water quality predictions. The results show that this model has an acceptable accuracy. In the future, the concentration of CODMn will meet the water quality targets at most stations in the Yangtze River, but the concentration of TP will not be able to meet the water quality target at 28.5 % of the stations. Furthermore, the prediction value of CODMn is 62.2 % lower than the target on average. However, the prediction value of TP is only 24.4 % lower than the target on average, and it will exceed the water target by >50 % at some stations.

As such, published articles on water quality monitoring and assessment are meant to convey essential and reliable information to water quality experts, decision-makers, researchers, students, and the public. The implication is that such information must emanate from data obtained and analysed in an up-to-date, scientifically sound manner. Thus, inappropriate data analysis and reporting techniques could yield misleading results and mar the endeavours of achieving error-free conclusions. This study utilises the findings on water quality assessment in Nigeria over the last 20 years to reveal the likely trends in water quality research regarding data collection, data analysis, and reporting for physicochemical, bacteriological parameters, and trace organics. A total of 123 Web of Science and quartile ranked (Q1-Q4) published articles involving water quality assessment in Nigeria were analysed. Results indicated shortcomings in various aspects of data analysis and reporting. Consequently, we use simulated heatmaps and graphs to illustrate preferred ways of analysing, reporting, and visualising some regularly used descriptive and inferential statistics of water quality variables. Finally, we highlight alternative approaches to the customarily applied water quality assessment methods in Nigeria and emphasise other areas of deficiency that need attention for improved water quality research.","The authors immensely thank Professor Michael Greenacre for his constructive feedback and guidance that brought this article to our desired standard.

Accurate and intelligent working condition recognition of pumping systems imposes major impacts on oilfield production benefits and efficiency. The shape of dynamometer card reflects the working conditions of sucker-rod pumping systems, and different conditions can be indicated by their typical card characteristics. In traditional identification methods, however, features are manually extracted based on specialist experience and domain knowledge. In this paper, an automatic fault diagnosis method is proposed to recognize the working conditions of sucker-rod pumping systems with massive dynamometer card data collected by sensors. Firstly, AlexNet-based transfer learning is adopted to automatically extract representative features from various dynamometer cards. Secondly, with the extracted features, error-correcting output codes model-based SVM is designed to identify the working conditions and improve the fault diagnosis accuracy and efficiency. The proposed AlexNet-SVM algorithm is validated against a real dataset from an oilfield. The results reveal that the proposed method reduces the need for human labor and improves the recognition accuracy.",We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and academic editor for their comments and suggestions.

Data-driven models play a key role in predicting inflow mechanisms without considering physical changes. However, the existing models are limited by nonlinearity and non-stationarity. Thus, the principal objective of this study was to propose two robust models, the DIFF-TCN model and the DIFF-LSTM model, for predicting the average water inflow per day. The models consist of three methods, namely Difference Method (DIFF), Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM). When applied to the Tingnan Coal Mine, Shanxi Province, China, the DIFF-TCN performs better in predicting the average daily water inflow, the model has a MAE of 5.88 m3/h, RMSE of 6.85 m3/h and R2 of 0.96 in the test stage of the water inflow event. Comparison with the other deep learning models (with similar complex structures) and traditional time series model shows the superiority of our proposed DIFF-TCN model. The SHAP value is used to explain the contribution of each model input to the predicted values, and it indicates that the historical time of water inflow data are the most important input, and the advance distance and the groundwater level data also contribute to the model predictions, but groundwater level data for some periods in the past may have a detrimental effect on the model. The findings of this study can provide better understanding about potential of robust deep learning models for smart hydrological forecasting, and they can also provide technical guidance for mining safety production and protection of water resources and water environment around the mining area.","This work was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFC0804102), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: U2267217, 42141011, 51974126, 51774136).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,2023-02-08,2023,2023-02-08,2023-05,871,,162056,Closed,Article,"Yang, Songlin; Lian, Huiqing; Xu, Bin; Thanh, Hung Vo; Chen, Wei; Yin, Huichao; Dai, Zhenxue","Yang, Songlin (College of Civil Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China.); Lian, Huiqing (Hebei State Key Laboratory of Mine Disaster Prevention, North China Institute of Science and Technology, Beijing Yanjiao 101601, China.); Xu, Bin (Hebei State Key Laboratory of Mine Disaster Prevention, North China Institute of Science and Technology, Beijing Yanjiao 101601, China.); Thanh, Hung Vo (Laboratory for Computational Mechanics, Institute for Computational Science and Artificial Intelligence, Van Lang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam; Faculty of Mechanical - Electrical and Computer Engineering, School of Technology, Van Lang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.); Chen, Wei (College of Civil Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China.); Yin, Huichao (School of Information Engineering, Institute of Disaster Prevention, Langfang 065201, China.

Speech signal has involved a great attention in human-computer interaction. Therefore, emotion recognition from speech has become a hot research topic in the field of interacting machines with humans. In this paper, we proposed a novel speech emotion recognition system by adopting multivariate time series handcrafted feature representation from speech signals. Bidirectional echo state network with two parallel reservoir layers has been applied to capture additional independent information. The parallel reservoirs produce multiple representations for each direction from the bidirectional data with two stages of concatenation. The sparse random projection approach has been adopted to reduce the high-dimensional sparse output for each direction separately from both reservoirs. Random over-sampling and random under-sampling methods are used to overcome the imbalanced nature of the used speech emotion datasets. The performance of the proposed parallel ESN model is evaluated from the speaker-independent experiments on EMO-DB, SAVEE, RAVDESS, and FAU Aibo datasets. The results show that the proposed SER model is superior to the single reservoir and the state-of-the-art studies.","This work was supported in part by the COVID-19 Special Research Grant under Project CSRG008-2020ST, Impact Oriented Interdisciplinary Research Grant Programme (IIRG), IIRG002C-19HWB from University of Malaya, and the AUA-UAEU Joint Research Grant 31R188.",,Neural Computing and Applications,,,2022-05-31,2022,2022-05-31,2022-10,34,20,17581-17599,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ibrahim, Hemin; Loo, Chu Kiong; Alnajjar, Fady","Ibrahim, Hemin (Department of Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); Loo, Chu Kiong (Department of Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); Alnajjar, Fady (College of Information Technology, UAE University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates)","Loo, Chu Kiong (University of Malaya)","Ibrahim, Hemin (University of Malaya); Loo, Chu Kiong (University of Malaya); Alnajjar, Fady (United Arab Emirates University)",3,3,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00521-022-07410-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148298702,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

In southeastern Nigeria, works that have used data-driven algorithms in predicting PTEs in groundwater are scarce. In addition, only a few works have simulated water quality indices using machine learning modelling methods in the region. Therefore, in this study, physicochemical analyses were carried out on groundwater samples in southeastern Nigeria. The laboratory results were used to compute two water quality indices: pollution index of groundwater (PIG) and the water pollution index (WPI), to ascertain groundwater quality. In addition, the physicochemical parameters served as input variables for multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) modelling and prediction of Cr, Fe, Ni, NO3−, Pb, Zn, WPI, and PIG. The results of WPI and PIG computation showed that about 30–35% of the groundwater samples were unsuitable for human consumption, whereas 65–70% of the samples were deemed suitable. The insights from the PIG and WPI model also revealed that lead (Pb) was the most influential PTE that degraded the quality of groundwater resources in the research area. The findings of the MLR and ANN models indicated strong positive prediction accuracies (R2 = 0.856–1.000) with low modeling errors. The predictive MLR and ANN models of the PIG and WPI generally outperformed those of the PTEs. The models produced in this study predicted the PTEs better compared to previous studies.

7896,pub.1146544251,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154722,35339552,,New double decomposition deep learning methods for river water level forecasting,"Forecasting river water levels or streamflow water levels (SWL) is vital to optimising the practical and sustainable use of available water resources. We propose a new deep learning hybrid model for SWL forecasting using convolutional neural networks (CNN), bi-directional long-short term memory (BiLSTM), and ant colony optimisation (ACO) with a two-phase decomposition approach at the 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day forecast horizons. The newly developed CBILSTM method is coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) methods to extract the most significant features within predictor variables to build a hybrid CVMD-CBiLSTM model. We integrate three distinct datasets (satellite-derived, climate mode indices, and ground-based meteorological observations) to improve the forecasting capability of the CVMD-CBiLSTM model, applied at nineteen different gauging stations in the Australian Murray River system. This proposed model returns a significantly accurate performance with ~98% of all prediction errors within less than ±0.020 m and a low relative root mean square of ~0.08%, demonstrating its superiority over several benchmark models. The results show that using the new hybrid deep learning algorithm with ACO feature selection can significantly improve the accuracy of forecasted river water levels, and therefore, the method is attractive for adopting remote sensing data to the model ground-based river flow for strategic water savings planning initiatives and dealing with climate change-induced extreme events such as drought events.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is considered one of the most influential algorithms in the field. Eighteen years after its invention, a plethora of methods have been proposed that extend NEAT in different aspects. In this article, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) to list and categorize the methods succeeding NEAT. Our review protocol identified 232 papers by merging the findings of two major electronic databases. Applying criteria that determine the paper's relevance and assess its quality, resulted in 61 methods that are presented in this article. Our review article proposes a new categorization scheme of NEAT's successors into three clusters. NEAT-based methods are categorized based on 1) whether they consider issues specific to the search space or the fitness landscape, 2) whether they combine principles from NE and another domain, or 3) the particular properties of the evolved ANNs. The clustering supports researchers 1) understanding the current state of the art that will enable them, 2) exploring new research directions or 3) benchmarking their proposed method to the state of the art, if they are interested in comparing, and 4) positioning themselves in the domain or 5) selecting a method that is most appropriate for their problem.",,,Evolutionary Computation,,"Algorithms; Biological Evolution; Neural Networks, Computer",2020-11-05,2020,2020-11-05,2021-03,29,1,1-73,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Papavasileiou, Evgenia; Cornelis, Jan; Jansen, Bart","Papavasileiou, Evgenia (Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, B-1050, Belgium imec, Leuven, B-3001, Belgium, epapavas@etrovub.be); Cornelis, Jan (Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, B-1050, Belgium, jpcornel@etrovub.be); Jansen, Bart (Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, B-1050, Belgium imec, Leuven, B-3001, Belgium, bjansen@etrovub.be)",,"Papavasileiou, Evgenia (Vrije Universiteit Brussel); Cornelis, Jan (Vrije Universiteit Brussel); Jansen, Bart (Vrije Universiteit Brussel)",17,17,0.68,8.06,https://direct.mit.edu/evco/article-pdf/29/1/1/1888486/evco_a_00282.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132326603,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

A significant issue of the Indian rivers is the massive water pollution, leading to the spreading of different diseases due to its daily use. Therefore, this study investigates three aspects. The first one is testing the hypothesis of the existence of a monotonic trend of the series of eight water parameters of the Brahmaputra River recorded for 17 years at ten hydrological stations. When this hypothesis was rejected, a loess trend was fitted. The second aspect is to assess the water quality using three indicators (WQI)-CCME WQI, British Colombia, and a weighted index. The third aspect is to group the years and the stations in clusters used to determine the regional (spatial) and temporal trend of the WQI series, utilizing a new algorithm. A statistical analysis does not reject the hypothesis of a monotonic trend presence for the spatially distributed data but not for the temporal ones. Hierarchical clustering based on the computed WQIs detected two clusters for the spatially distributed data and two for the temporal-distributed data. The procedure proposed for determining the WQI temporal and regional evolution provided good results in terms of mean absolute error, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).",,,Toxics,,,2021-11-06,2021,2021-11-06,,9,11,297,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barbulescu, Alina; Barbes, Lucica; Dumitriu, Cristian Stefan","Barbulescu, Alina (Department of Civil Engineering, Transilvania University of Brașov, 5 Turnului Str., 900152 Brașov, Romania;, alina.barbulescu@unitbv.ro); Barbes, Lucica (Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Ovidius University of Constanta, 124 Mamaia Bd., 900527 Constanta, Romania); Dumitriu, Cristian Stefan (SC Utilnavorep SA, 55 Aurel Vlaicu Av., 900055 Constanta, Romania)","Barbes, Lucica (Ovidius University); Dumitriu, Cristian Stefan ","Barbulescu, Alina (Transylvania University of Brașov); Barbes, Lucica (Ovidius University); Dumitriu, Cristian Stefan ()",7,7,0.41,3.34,https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/9/11/297/pdf?version=1636193371,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143152538,37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology,

This study proposed a set of supervised machine learning (ML) models to delineate the GWL changes in the Zarand-Saveh complex aquifer in Iran using 15-year (2005–2020) monthly dataset. The wavelet transform (WT) procedure was also used to improve the GWL prediction ability of ML models for 3-month horizons using input datasets of precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, and GWL. The four well-accepted standalone ML methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), group method of data handling (GMDH), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM), were implemented and compared with the hybrid wavelet conjunction models. The methods were compared based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Comparison outcomes showed that the hybrid wavelet–ML considerably improved the standalone model results. The wavelet transform-least square support vector machine (WT-LSSVM) model was superior to other standalone and hybrid wavelet–ML methods to predict GWL. The best GWL predictions were acquired from the WT-LSSVM model with input scenario 5 involving all influential variables, and this model produced RMSE, MAE, R, and NSE as 0.05, 0.04, 0.99, and 0.99 for 1 month ahead of GWL prediction, while the corresponding values were obtained as 0.18, 0.14, 0.95, and 0.90 for 3 months ahead of GWL prediction, respectively.",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,"Environmental Monitoring; Neural Networks, Computer; Groundwater; Support Vector Machine; Temperature",2022-10-29,2022,2022-10-29,2023-02,30,9,22863-22884,Closed,Article,"Samani, Saeideh; Vadiati, Meysam; Nejatijahromi, Zohre; Etebari, Behrooz; Kisi, Ozgur","Samani, Saeideh (Department of Water Resources Study and Research, Water Research Institute (WRI), Tehran Province, District 4, Bahar Blvd, Tehran, Iran); Vadiati, Meysam (Global Affairs, Hubert H.

Sensors aboard satellites like Landsat series, which have data freely available usually lack the spatial resolution that suborbital sensors have. Many techniques have been developed to improve spatial resolution through data fusion. However, most of them have serious limitations regarding application and scale. Recently Super-Resolution (SR) convolution neural networks have been tested with encouraging results. However, they require large datasets, more time and computational power for training. To overcome these limitations, this work aims to increase the spatial resolution of multispectral bands from the Landsat satellite database using a modified artificial neural network that uses pixel kernels of a single spatial high-resolution RGB image from Google Earth as input. The methodology was validated with a common dataset of indoor images as well as a specific area of Landsat 8. Different downsized scale inputs were used for training where the validation used the ground truth of the original size images, obtaining comparable results to the recent works. With the method validated, we generated high spatial resolution spectral bands based on RGB images from Google Earth on a carbonated outcrop area, which were then properly classified according to the soil spectral responses making use of the advantage of a higher spatial resolution dataset.",,"This research was funded by PETROBRAS and ANP grant numbers 4600556376 and 4600583791, the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001.",Sensors,,,2020-06-23,2020,2020-06-23,,20,12,3559,All OA; Gold,Article,"Marques, Ademir; de Souza, Eniuce Menezes; Müller, Marianne; Brum, Diego; Zanotta, Daniel Capella; Horota, Rafael Kenji; Kupssinskü, Lucas Silveira; Veronez, Maurício Roberto; Gonzaga, Luiz; Cazarin, Caroline Lessio","Marques, Ademir (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); de Souza, Eniuce Menezes (Department of Statistics, State University of Maringá, Maringá PR 87020-900, Brazil;, emsouza@uem.br); Müller, Marianne (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); Brum, Diego (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); Zanotta, Daniel Capella (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); Horota, Rafael Kenji (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); Kupssinskü, Lucas Silveira (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); Veronez, Maurício Roberto (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); Gonzaga, Luiz (Vizlab|X-Reality and Geoinformatics Lab, Graduate Programme in Applied Computing, Unisinos University, São Leopoldo RS 93022-750, Brazil;, marianne@edu.unisinos.br, (M.M.);, diebrum@unisinos.br, (D.B.);, dzanotta@edu.unisinos.br, (D.C.Z.);, khorota@edu.unisinos.br, (R.K.H.);, lkupssinsku@edu.unisinos.br, (L.S.K.);, VERONEZ@unisinos.br, (M.R.V.);, lgonzaga@unisinos.br, (L.G.J.)); Cazarin, Caroline Lessio (CENPES-PETROBRAS - Centro de Pesquisas Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello, Rio de Janeiro RJ 21941-598, Brazil;, cazarin@petrobras.com.br)","Marques, Ademir (; )","Marques, Ademir (); de Souza, Eniuce Menezes (State University of Maringa); Müller, Marianne (); Brum, Diego (); Zanotta, Daniel Capella (); Horota, Rafael Kenji (); Kupssinskü, Lucas Silveira (); Veronez, Maurício Roberto (); Gonzaga, Luiz (); Cazarin, Caroline Lessio ()",2,2,,0.75,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/12/3559/pdf?version=1593340071,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128759688,40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Moreover, we find that a mesoporous cellulose membrane transforms into homeostatic material with properties that include high ion conductivity, excellent flexibility and stability, appropriate adhesion force, and self-healing effects when swollen in a saline solution. The proposed biosensor is found to maintain a stable skin-sensor interface through homeostasis even when challenged by various stresses, such as a dynamic environment, severe detachment, dense hair, sweat, and long-term measurement.

AI methods are well suited to predict clinical outcomes. In practice, AI methods can be thought of as functions that learn the outcomes accompanying standardized input data to produce accurate outcome predictions when trialed with new data. Current methods for cleaning, creating, accessing, extracting, augmenting, and representing data for training AI clinical prediction models are well defined. The use of AI to predict clinical outcomes is a dynamic and rapidly evolving arena, with new methods and applications emerging. Extraction or accession of electronic health care records and combining these with patient genetic data is an area of present attention, with tremendous potential for future growth. Machine learning approaches, including decision tree methods of Random Forest and XGBoost, and deep learning techniques including deep multi-layer and recurrent neural networks, afford unique capabilities to accurately create predictions from high dimensional, multimodal data. Furthermore, AI methods are increasing our ability to accurately predict clinical outcomes that previously were difficult to model, including time-dependent and multi-class outcomes.

For the past two decades, various studies have been conducted in which metagenomics data have been collected over extended periods and analyzed spatially and temporally to understand the dynamics of microbial communities in DWDS. In this literature review, we outline the findings which were reported in the literature on what kind of occupancy-abundance patterns are exhibited in the drinking water microbiome, how the drinking water microbiome dynamically evolves spatially and temporally in the distribution networks, how different microbial communities co-exist, and what kind of clusters exist in the drinking water ecosystem. While data analysis in the current literature concerns mainly with confirmatory and exploratory questions pertaining to the use of metagenomics data for the analysis of DWDS microbiome, we present also future perspectives and the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) and mechanistic models to address the predictive and mechanistic questions. The integration of meta-omics, AI, and mechanistic models transcends metagenomics into functional metagenomics, enabling deterministic understanding and control of DWDS for clean and safe drinking water systems of the future.","This work was performed in the cooperation framework of Wetsus, European Centre of excellence for sustainable water technology (www.wetsus.nl).

LSWF is a complex process controlled by several mechanisms and parameters involving oil, brine, and rock composition. The major mechanisms and processes controlling LSWF are still being debated in the literature. Thus, the establishment of an approach that relates these parameters to the final recovery factor (RFf) is vital. The main objective of this research work was to use a number of artificial intelligence models to develop robust predictive models based on experimental data and main parameters controlling the LSWF determined through sensitivity analysis and feature selection. The parameters include properties of oil, rock, injected brine, and connate water. Different operational parameters were considered to increase the model accuracy as well. After collecting the relevant data from 99 experimental studies reported in the literature, the database underwent a comprehensive and rigorous data preprocessing stage, which included removal of duplicates and low-variance features, missing value imputation, collinearity assessment, data characteristic assessment, outlier removal, feature selection, data splitting (80-20 rule was applied), and data scaling. Then, a number of methods such as linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and committee machine intelligent system (CMIS) were used to link 1316 data samples assembled in this research work. Based on the obtained results, the CMIS model was proven to produce superior results compared to its counterparts such that the root mean squared rrror (RMSE) values for both training and testing data are 4.622 and 7.757, respectively. Based on the feature importance results, the presence of Ca2+ in the connate water, Na+ in the injected brine, core porosity, and total acid number of the crude oil are detected as the parameters with the highest impact on the RFf. The CMIS model proposed here can be applied with a high degree of confidence to predict the performance of LSWF in sandstone reservoirs. The database assembled for the purpose of this research work is so far the largest and most comprehensive of its kind, and it can be used to further delineate mechanisms behind LSWF and optimization of this EOR process in sandstone reservoirs.","The authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their critical yet fair and constructive comments, which helped the authors to improve the quality of the manuscript.

For this purpose, 13 independent variables affecting GES in the study area, namely, altitude, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, drainage density, distance from a river, land use, soil, lithology, rainfall, stream power index (SPI), and topographic wetness index (TWI), were prepared. A total of 132 gully erosion locations were identified during field visits. To implement the proposed model, the dataset was divided into the two categories of training (70%) and testing (30%). The results indicate that the area under the curve (AUC) value from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) considering the testing datasets of PSO-DLNN is 0.89, which indicates superb accuracy. The rest of the models are associated with optimal accuracy and have similar results to the PSO-DLNN model; the AUC values from ROC of DLNN, SVM, and ANN for the testing datasets are 0.87, 0.85, and 0.84, respectively. The efficiency of the proposed model in terms of prediction of GES was increased. Therefore, it can be concluded that the DLNN model and its ensemble with the PSO algorithm can be used as a novel and practical method to predict gully erosion susceptibility, which can help planners and managers to manage and reduce the risk of this phenomenon.",We acknowledge the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar within the Open-Access Publishing Program.,"This research was funded by the Hungarian-Mexican bilateral Scientific and Technological project, grant number 2019-2.1.11-TET-2019-00007.",Sensors,,,2020-09-30,2020,2020-09-30,,20,19,5609,All OA; Gold,Article,"Band, Shahab S.; Janizadeh, Saeid; Pal, Subodh Chandra; Saha, Asish; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Shokri, Manouchehr; Mosavi, Amirhosein","Band, Shahab S.

It is highly vital for hydropower operation, agricultural planning, and flood control. In this study, the convolution neural network (CNN) and Long-Short-term Memory network (LSTM) are combined to make a new integrated model called CNN-LSTM to predict the hourly Qflow (short-term) at Brisbane River and Teewah Creek, Australia. The CNN layers were used to extract the features of Qflow time-series, while the LSTM networks use these features from CNN for Qflow time series prediction. The proposed CNN-LSTM model is benchmarked against the standalone model CNN, LSTM, and Deep Neural Network models and several conventional artificial intelligence (AI) models. Qflow prediction is conducted for different time intervals with the length of 1-Week, 2-Weeks, 4-Weeks, and 9-Months, respectively. With the help of different performance metrics and graphical analysis visualization, the experimental results reveal that with small residual error between the actual and predicted Qflow, the CNN-LSTM model outperforms all the benchmarked conventional AI models as well as ensemble models for all the time intervals. With 84% of Qflow prediction error below the range of 0.05 m3 s−1, CNN-LSTM demonstrates a better performance compared to 80% and 66% for LSTM and DNN, respectively. In summary, the results reveal that the proposed CNN-LSTM model based on the novel framework yields more accurate predictions. Thus, CNN-LSTM has significant practical value in Qflow prediction.",The paper utilized hourly streamflow data from the Water Monitoring Data Portal (Dept of Environment &amp; Resource Management) are duly acknowledged.

The difficulty of making an accurate and timely diagnosis is exacerbated by a lack of resources and professionals in some areas, which contributes to this reality. Medical professionals may benefit from technological advancements that aid in the accurate diagnosis of patients. In light of these findings, a hybrid diagnostic tool has been developed that combines several computational intelligence (machine learning) techniques capable of analyzing clinical histories and images of electrocardiogram signals and indicating whether or not the patient has ischemic heart disease with up to 97.01% accuracy. Working with medical experts and a database containing clinical data on approximately 1020 patients and their diagnoses was required for this project. Both were put to use.

This paper proposes a novel Brain-Inspired Spiking Neural Network (BI-SNN) model for incremental learning of spike sequences. BI-SNN maps spiking activity from input channels into a high dimensional source-space which enhances the evolution of polychronising spiking neural populations. We applied the BI-SNN to predict muscle activity and kinematics from electroencephalography signals during upper limb functional movements. The BI-SNN extends our previously proposed eSPANNet computational model by integrating it with the ‘NeuCube’ brain-inspired SNN architecture. We show that BI-SNN can successfully predict continuous muscle activity and kinematics of upper-limb. The experimental results confirmed that the BI-SNN resulted in strongly correlated population activity and demonstrated the feasibility for real-time prediction. In contrast to the majority of Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that constitute a ‘black box’, BI-SNN provide quantitative and visual feedback about the related brain activity. This study is one of the first attempts to examine the feasibility of finding neural correlates of muscle activity and kinematics from electroencephalography using a brain-inspired computational paradigm. The findings suggest that BI-SNN is a better neural decoder for non-invasive BCI.",This research was supported by the SRIF Interact 2017-2019 Grant from the Auckland University of Technology.,,Scientific Reports,,"Brain; Brain Waves; Female; Hand; Humans; Male; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Nerve Net",2021-01-28,2021,2021-01-28,,11,1,2486,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kumarasinghe, Kaushalya; Kasabov, Nikola; Taylor, Denise","Kumarasinghe, Kaushalya (Knowledge Engineering and Discovery Research Institute, Auckland University of Technology, AUT Tower, Level 7, cnr Rutland and Wakefield Street, 1010, Auckland, New Zealand; Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Information Technology, University of Moratuwa, Katubedda, Sri Lanka); Kasabov, Nikola (School of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, 1010, Auckland, New Zealand; George Moore Chair in Cognitive Data Analytics, Ulster University, Derry, UK); Taylor, Denise (Rehabilitation Innovation Centre, Health & Rehabilitation Research Institute, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand)","Kumarasinghe, Kaushalya (Auckland University of Technology; University of Moratuwa)","Kumarasinghe, Kaushalya (Auckland University of Technology; University of Moratuwa); Kasabov, Nikola (Auckland University of Technology; University of Ulster); Taylor, Denise (Auckland University of Technology)",19,19,0.99,11.81,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81805-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134922146,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

We developed three deep learning (DL) models for detecting STEMIs and culprit vessels based on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and compared them with conclusions of experienced doctors, including cardiologists, emergency physicians, and internists. After screening the coronary angiography (CAG) results, 883 cases (506 control and 377 STEMI) from internal and external datasets were enrolled for testing DL models. Convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) (AUC: 0.99) performed better than CNN, LSTM, and doctors in detecting STEMI. Deep learning models (AUC: 0.96) performed similarly to experienced cardiologists and emergency physicians in discriminating the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Regarding distinguishing RCA from LCX, DL models were comparable to doctors (AUC: 0.81). In summary, we developed ECG-based DL diagnosis systems to detect STEMI and predict culprit vessel occlusion, thus enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of STEMI diagnosis.","We thank Jianning Chen, Lianxiong Yuan, Ximei Zhang, Xiaoyan Yang, Li Xu, Yuen Liang, Libo Huang, Li Lidi, Hongli Chen, and Borui Tian at The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University.

As such, in this study, we investigated water quality indices (WQIs), trophic status indices (TSIs), and heavy metal indices (HMIs) for assessing surface water quality. Based on these indices, we summarised and compared water assessment models using expert system (ES) and machine learning (ML) methods. We also discussed the current status and future perspectives of water quality management. The results of our analyses showed that assessment indices can be used in three aspects of surface water quality assessment: WQIs are aggregated from multiple parameters and commonly used in surface water quality classification; TSIs are calculated from the concentrations of different nutrients required for algae and bacteria, and employed to evaluate the eutrophication levels of lakes and reservoirs; HMIs are mainly applied for human health risk assessment and the analysis of correlation of heavy metal sources. ES- and ML-based assessment models have been developed to efficiently generate assessment indices and predict water quality status based on big data obtained from new techniques. By implementing dynamic monitoring and analysis of water quality, we designed a next-generation water quality management system based on the above indices and assessment models, which shows promise for improving the accuracy of water quality assessment.","The research work was funded by “The Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program” in 2019 (Grant No. 2019CX01G338), Guangdong Province, China and the Research Funding of Shantou University for New Faculty Member (Grant No. NTF19024-2019), China.",,Environmental Pollution,,"Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Humans; Lakes; Metals, Heavy; Water Quality",2022-06-15,2022,2022-06-15,2022-09,308,,119611,Closed,Article,"Yan, Tao; Shen, Shui-Long; Zhou, Annan","Yan, Tao (MOE Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Technology, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Shantou University, Shantou, Guangdong, 515063, China; Discipline of Civil and Infrastructure, School of Engineering, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), Victoria, 3001, Australia.

However, these similarities do not directly transfer to the success of efficient computation without device and algorithm co-designs and optimizations. Contemporary deep learning algorithms demand the memristive artificial synapses to ideally possess analog weighting and linear weight-update behavior, requiring substantial device-level and circuit-level optimization. Such co-design and optimization have been the main focus of memristive neuromorphic engineering, which often abandons the ""non-ideal"" behaviors of memristive devices, although many of them resemble what have been observed in biological components. Novel brain-inspired algorithms are being proposed to utilize such behaviors as unique features to further enhance the efficiency and intelligence of neuromorphic computing, which calls for collaborations among electrical engineers, computing scientists, and neuroscientists.","This work was partially supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) for the support through the MURI program under Contract No. FA9550-19-1-0213.

The present study has attempted to address the issue of sensitivity of different clusters of factors towards gully erosion in the Mayurakshi river basin. Firstly, the gully erosion susceptibility of the basin area has been mapped by integrating using 18 parameters divided into four factor-cluster, viz. erodibility, erosivity, resistance, and topographical cluster, with the help of four machine learning (ML) models such as random forest (RF), gradient boost (GBM), extreme gradient boost (XGB), and support vector machine (SVM). Results show that almost 20% and 25% of the upper catchment of the basin belongs to extreme and high gully erosion susceptibility. Among the applied algorithms, RF is appeared as the best performing model. The spatial association of factor cluster-based models with the final susceptibility model is found the highest for the erosivity cluster, followed by the erodibility cluster. From the sensitivity analysis, it becomes clear that geology and soil texture are dominant contributing factors to gully erosion susceptibility. The geological formation of unclassified granite gneiss and geomorphological formation of denudational origin pediment-pediplain complex is dominant over the entire upper catchment of the basin, and therefore, can be considered regional factors of importance. Since the study has figured out the different grades of susceptible areas with dominant factors and factor cluster, it would be useful for devising planning for gully erosion check measures. From economic particularly food security purpose, it is very essential since it is concerned with precious soil loss and negative effects on agriculture.","For this study, the authors would like to convey their gratitude to USGS for providing Landsat imageries.

The results of these applications show that the monthly baseflow frequency of the river ecological flow conditions of the two stations in the dry season is 20 % (7.49 m3/s) and 30 % (4.79 m3/s), respectively. The ecological flow level early warning forecasting accuracy is close to 90 % in the BZA and SD stations during dry and wet seasons. The variations of ecological flow are most affected by evaporation and base flow index. The results of this study can serve as a strong basis for the effective allocation and utilization of locally available water resources.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

METHODS: Forty-three CA (32 males; 79 years (IQR 71; 85)), 20 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, 10 males; 63.9 years (±7.4)) and 44 healthy controls (CTRL, 23 males; 56.3 years (IQR 52.5; 62.9)) received cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Left atrial, right atrial and right ventricular strain parameters and cardiac function generated a 41-feature matrix for decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), SVM linear and SVM radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm processing. A 10-feature principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using SVM linear and RBF.
RESULTS: Forty-one features resulted in diagnostic accuracies of 87.9% (AUC = 0.960) for SVM linear, 90.9% (0.996; Precision = 94%; Sensitivity = 100%; F1-Score = 97%) using RBF kernel, 84.9% (0.970) for KNN, and 78.8% (0.787) for DT. The 10-feature PCA achieved 78.9% (0.962) via linear SVM and 81.8% (0.996) via RBF SVM. Explained variance presented bi-atrial longitudinal strain and left and right atrial ejection fraction as valuable CA predictors.
CONCLUSION: SVM RBF kernel achieved competitive diagnostic accuracies under supervised conditions. Machine learning of multi-chamber cardiac strain and function may offer novel perspectives for non-contrast clinical decision-support systems in CA diagnostics.",We acknowledge support by the Open Access Publication Funds of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum.,This research received no external funding.,Diagnostics,,,2022-11-04,2022,2022-11-04,,12,11,2693,All OA; Gold,Article,"Eckstein, Jan; Moghadasi, Negin; Körperich, Hermann; Valdés, Elena Weise; Sciacca, Vanessa; Paluszkiewicz, Lech; Burchert, Wolfgang; Piran, Misagh","Eckstein, Jan (Institute for Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, 32545 Bad Oeynhausen, Germany); Moghadasi, Negin (Department of Engineering Systems & Environment, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904, USA); Körperich, Hermann (Institute for Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, 32545 Bad Oeynhausen, Germany); Valdés, Elena Weise (Institute for Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, 32545 Bad Oeynhausen, Germany); Sciacca, Vanessa (Clinic for Electrophysiology, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, 32545 Bad Oeynhausen, Germany); Paluszkiewicz, Lech (Clinic for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, 32545 Bad Oeynhausen, Germany); Burchert, Wolfgang (Institute for Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, 32545 Bad Oeynhausen, Germany); Piran, Misagh (Institute for Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Heart and Diabetes Center North-Rhine Westphalia, Ruhr-University of Bochum, 32545 Bad Oeynhausen, Germany)","Körperich, Hermann (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia)","Eckstein, Jan (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia); Moghadasi, Negin (University of Virginia); Körperich, Hermann (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia); Valdés, Elena Weise (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia); Sciacca, Vanessa (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia); Paluszkiewicz, Lech (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia); Burchert, Wolfgang (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia); Piran, Misagh (Heart and Diabetes Center North Rhine-Westphalia)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/12/11/2693/pdf?version=1667915994,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152499317,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

A broad variety of AI-ECG approaches exist, each having differing advantages and limitations relating to their creation and application.
PURPOSE: To provide illustrative comparison of two general AI-ECG modeling approaches: machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).
METHOD COMPARISON: Two AI-ECG algorithms were developed to carry out two separate tasks using ML and DL, respectively. ML modeling techniques were used to create algorithms designed for automatic wide QRS complex tachycardia differentiation into ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia. A DL algorithm was formulated for the task of comprehensive 12‑lead ECG interpretation. First, we describe the ML models for WCT differentiation, which rely upon expert domain knowledge to identify and formulate ECG features (e.g., percent monophasic time-voltage area [PMonoTVA]) that enable strong diagnostic performance. Second, we describe the DL method for comprehensive 12‑lead ECG interpretation, which relies upon the independent recognition and analysis of a virtually incalculable number of ECG features from a vast collection of standard 12‑lead ECGs.
CONCLUSION: We have showcased two different AI-ECG methods, namely ML and DL respectively. In doing so, we highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. It is essential for investigators to understand these differences when attempting to create and apply novel AI-ECG solutions.","Disclosures .Anthony Kashou, Adam May, and Peter Noseworthy are potential beneficiaries of intellectual property discussed in the article.

After the stroke, the damaged area of the brain will not operate normally. As a result, early detection is crucial for more effective therapy. Computed tomography (CT) images supply a rapid diagnosis of brain stroke. However, while doctors are analyzing each brain CT image, time is running fast. This circumstance may lead to result in a delay in treatment and making errors. Therefore, we targeted the utilization of an efficient artificial intelligence algorithm in stroke detection. In this paper, we designed hybrid algorithms that include a new convolution neural networks (CNN) architecture called OzNet and various machine learning algorithms for binary classification of real brain stroke CT images. When we classified the dataset with OzNet, we acquired successful performance. However, for this target, we combined it with a minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method and Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In addition, 4096 significant features were obtained from the fully connected layer of OzNet, and we reduced the dimension of features from 4096 to 250 using the mRMR method. Finally, we utilized these machine learning algorithms to classify important features. As a result, OzNet-mRMR-NB was an excellent hybrid algorithm and achieved an accuracy of 98.42% and AUC of 0.99 to detect stroke from brain CT images.","This paper is based on Ph.D. thesis of Ozaltin, O. and supervised by Yeniay, O.",This research received no external funding.,Bioengineering,,,2022-12-08,2022,2022-12-08,,9,12,783,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ozaltin, Oznur; Coskun, Orhan; Yeniay, Ozgur; Subasi, Abdulhamit","Ozaltin, Oznur (Institute of Science, Department of Statistics, Beytepe Campus, Hacettepe University, Ankara 06800, Turkey); Coskun, Orhan (Gaziosmanpasa Training and Research Hospital, Pediatric Neurology, Health Sciences University, Gaziosmanpasa, Istanbul 34779, Turkey); Yeniay, Ozgur (Institute of Science, Department of Statistics, Beytepe Campus, Hacettepe University, Ankara 06800, Turkey); Subasi, Abdulhamit (Institute of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Turku, 20520 Turku, Finland; Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, Effat University, Jeddah 21478, Saudi Arabia)","Ozaltin, Oznur (Hacettepe University)","Ozaltin, Oznur (Hacettepe University); Coskun, Orhan (İstanbul Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesi); Yeniay, Ozgur (Hacettepe University); Subasi, Abdulhamit (University of Turku; Effat University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/9/12/783/pdf?version=1671507964,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153546903,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

In recent years, this study area has been greatly influenced by several head-cut gullies due to unusual climatic factors and human induced activity. The present study is therefore intended to address this issue by developing head-cut gully erosion prediction maps using boosting ensemble machine learning algorithms, namely Boosted Tree (BT), Boosted Generalized Linear Models (BGLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Deep Boost (DB). Initially, we produced a gully erosion inventory map using a variety of resources, including published reports, Google Earth images, and field records of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Subsequently, we distributed this information randomly and choose 70% (102) of the test gullies and the remaining 30% (43) for validation. The methodology was designed using morphometric and thematic determinants, including 14 head-cut gully erosion conditioning features. We have also investigated the following: (a) Multi-collinearity analysis to determine the linearity of the independent variables, (b) Predictive capability of piping models using train and test dataset and (c) Variables importance affecting head-cut gully erosion. The study reveals that altitude, land use, distances from road and soil characteristics influenced the method with the greatest impact on head-cut gully erosion susceptibility. We presented five head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps and investigated their predictive accuracy through area under curve (AUC). The AUC test reveals that the DB machine learning method demonstrated significantly higher accuracy (AUC = 0.95) than the BT (AUC = 0.93), BGLM (AUC = 0.91), BRT (AUC = 0.94) and XGB (AUC = 0.92) approaches. The predicted head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps can be used by policy makers and local authorities for soil conservation and to prevent threats to human activities.","We would like to express our thanks to Jason Michael Evans (Co-Editors-in-Chief, Journal of Environmental Management) and anonymous reviewers for the evaluation of the manuscript and give their valuable comments regarding the improvement of the same.",,Journal of Environmental Management,,Conservation of Natural Resources; Deep Learning; Humans; Iran; Machine Learning; Soil,2021-01-28,2021,2021-01-28,2021-04,284,,112015,Closed,Article,"Chen, Wei; Lei, Xinxiang; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Chandra Pal, Subodh; Sahana, Mehebub; Janizadeh, Saeid","Chen, Wei (College of Geology & Environment, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an, 710054, Shaanxi, China; Key Laboratory of Coal Resources Exploration and Comprehensive Utilization, Ministry of Natural Resources, Xi'an, 710021, China.

The dramatic increase in population, the use of fertilizers and pesticides, and the industrial revolution have resulted in severe effects on the WQ environment. As a result, the prediction of WQ greatly helped to monitor water pollution. Accurate prediction of WQ is the foundation of managing water environments and is of high importance for protecting water environment. WQ data presents in the form of multi-variate time-sequence dataset. It is clear that the accuracy of predicting WQ will be enhanced when the multi-variate relation and time sequence dataset of WQ are fully utilized. This article presents the Water Quality Prediction utilising Sparrow Search Optimization with Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (WQP-SSHLSTM) model. The presented WQP-SSHLSTM model intends to examine the data and classify WQ into distinct classes. To achieve this, the presented WQP-SSHLSTM model undergoes data scaling process to scale the input data into uniform format. Followed by, a hybrid long short-term memory-deep belief network (LSTM-DBN) technique is employed for the recognition and classification of WQ. Moreover, Sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) is utilized as a hyperparameter optimizer of the proposed DBN-LSTM model. For demonstrating the enhanced outcomes of the presented WQP-SSHLSTM model, a sequence of experiments has been performed and the outcomes are reviewed under distinct prospects. The WQP-SSHLSTM model has achieved 99.84 percent accuracy, which is the maximum attainable. The simulation outcomes ensured the enhanced outcomes of the WQP-SSHLSTM model on recent methods.","The authors thank the Researchers Supporting Project number (RSP-2021/169), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the financial support.",,Chemosphere,,"Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Fertilizers; Memory, Short-Term; Pesticides; Sparrows; Water Quality",2022-07-18,2022,2022-07-18,2022-11,307,Pt 1,135762,Closed,Article,"Paul, Vince; Ramesh, R.; Sreeja, P.; Jarin, T.; Kumar, P.S.

However, the use of this technology in the veterinary medicine field is lagging behind, and there are many areas where it could be used with potentially successful outcomes and results. In this study, two critical predictions were explored in horses presented with acute abdomen (colic) using this technology. Those were the need for surgical intervention and survivability likelihood of affected horses based on clinical data (history, clinical examination findings, and diagnostic procedures). The two prediction parameters were explored using the application of Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Bayes Network, and Naïve Bayes. The machine learning algorithms were able to predict the need for surgery and survivability likelihood of horses presented with acute abdomen (colic) with 76% and 85% accuracy, respectively.

However, similar to other neural networks, they tend to suffer from a high computational cost to perform training. Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective way to define neural networks that are very efficient to train, often obtaining comparable predictive performance with respect to the fully trained counterparts. Different proposals of reservoir graph neural networks have been proposed in the literature. However, their predictive performances are still slightly below the ones of fully trained graph neural networks on many benchmark datasets, arguably because of the oversmoothing problem that arises when iterating over the graph structure in the reservoir computation. In this work, we aim to reduce this gap defining a multiresolution reservoir graph neural network (MRGNN) inspired by graph spectral filtering. Instead of iterating on the nonlinearity in the reservoir and using a shallow readout function, we aim to generate an explicit k -hop unsupervised graph representation amenable for further, possibly nonlinear, processing. Experiments on several datasets from various application areas show that our approach is extremely fast and it achieves in most of the cases comparable or even higher results with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.","This work was supported by the Department of Mathematics, University of Padua, with the provision of the necessary HPC resources.","This work was supported by the Department of Mathematics, University of Padua, through the SID/BIRD 2020 Project “Deep Graph Memory Networks.”",IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,"Algorithms; Neural Networks, Computer",2022-06-01,2022,2022-06-01,2022-06,33,6,2642-2653,Closed,Article,"Pasa, Luca; Navarin, Nicolò; Sperduti, Alessandro","Pasa, Luca (University of Padua, Department of Mathematics “Tullio Levi-Civita”, Human Inspired Technology Research Centre (HIT), 35121, Padua, Italy); Navarin, Nicolò (University of Padua, Department of Mathematics “Tullio Levi-Civita”, Human Inspired Technology Research Centre (HIT), 35121, Padua, Italy); Sperduti, Alessandro (University of Padua, Department of Mathematics “Tullio Levi-Civita”, Human Inspired Technology Research Centre (HIT), 35121, Padua, Italy)","Pasa, Luca (University of Padua)","Pasa, Luca (University of Padua); Navarin, Nicolò (University of Padua); Sperduti, Alessandro (University of Padua)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139510466,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

In order to improve the irrigation water use efficiency, it is necessary to predict the water requirements for crops in advance. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a hypothetical standard reference crop evapotranspiration, many types of artificial intelligence models have been applied to predict ETo; However, there are still few in the literature regarding the application of hybrid models for deep learning model parameters optimization. This paper proposes two hybrid models based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, used to predict ETo at the four climate stations, Shaanxi province, China. These two hybrid models were trained using 40 years of historical data, and the PSO was used to optimize the hyperparameters in the LSTM network. We applied the optimized model to predict the daily ETo in 2019 under different datasets, the result showed that the optimized model has good prediction accuracy.

However, current software implementation of neural networks is severely limited in terms of performance and energy efficiency. It is believed that further progress requires the development of neuromorphic systems, in which hardware directly mimics the neuronal network structure of a human brain. Here, we propose theoretically and realize experimentally an optical network of nodes performing binary operations. The nonlinearity required for efficient computation is provided by semiconductor microcavities in the strong quantum light-matter coupling regime, which exhibit exciton-polariton interactions. We demonstrate the system performance against a pattern recognition task, obtaining accuracy on a par with state-of-the-art hardware implementations.

One such application is the optimization of hydrocarbon production to maximize short-term income, and prolong the operational lifetime of production wells and the reservoir. While the measurement technology itself is well understood and developed, a key remaining challenge is the establishment of robust data analysis tools that are capable of providing real-time conversion of enormous data quantities into actionable process indicators. This paper provides a comprehensive technical review of the data analysis techniques for distributed fibre optic technologies, with a particular focus on characterizing fluid flow in pipes. The review encompasses classical methods, such as the speed of sound estimation and Joule-Thomson coefficient, as well as their data-driven machine learning counterparts, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithms. The study aims to help end-users establish reliable, robust, and accurate solutions that can be deployed in a timely and effective way, and pave the wave for future developments in the field.","The authors would like to thank Bjørnar Ystad and Yngve Heggelund for valuable discussions and suggestions.

Some refined topologies were initially motivated by neuronal network architectures found in the brain, such as convolutional ANN. Later topologies of neuronal networks departed from the biological substrate and began to be developed independently as the biological processing units are not well understood or are not transferable to in silico architectures. In the field of neuroscience, the advent of multichannel recordings has enabled recording the activity of many neurons simultaneously and characterizing complex network activity in biological neural networks (BNN). The unique opportunity to compare large neuronal network topologies, processing, and learning strategies with those that have been developed in state-of-the-art ANN has become a reality. The aim of this review is to introduce certain basic concepts of modern ANN, corresponding training algorithms, and biological counterparts. The selection of these modern ANN is prone to be biased (e.g., spiking neural networks are excluded) but may be sufficient for a concise overview.","This review was inspired by the brilliant book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron, a former employee of Google.

Since chlorophyll a (Chl-a) can be used as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass, it has been selected as a direct indicator for monitoring and early warning of algal blooms. With the development of artificial intelligence, data-driven approaches with small sample data and high accuracy prediction have been gradually applied to water quality prediction. This study aimed at using environment factors (water quality and meteorological data) to assist the prediction of Chl-a concentration based on the optimization support vector machine (SVM) model. The most relevant environment factors were extracted from the commonly used environment factors according to the method of cosine similarity. The traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was adopted to optimize the ANN and SVM models, respectively. Then, the better prediction model PSO-SVM can be obtained according to the results of three scientific evaluation indicators. The latest optimization algorithm of grey wolf optimizer (GWO) was also proposed to optimize the SVM to realize high-accuracy Chl-a concentration predication. The GWO-SVM model achieved higher accuracy than the other models both in training and validation processes. Therefore, the dimension of the input vector could be reduced with using the cosine similarity method, and the prediction of Chl-a concentration in high accuracy and the early warning of algal blooms in the study area of this paper could also achieved.","The supports of this work is by the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2020CFB292).

Prediction of water quality parameters becomes more challenging with these extremes since water quality is strongly related to hydro-meteorological conditions and is particularly sensitive to climate change. The evidence linking the influence of hydro-meteorological factors on water quality provides insights into future climatic extremes. Despite recent breakthroughs in water quality modeling and evaluations of climate change's impact on water quality, climate extreme informed water quality modeling methodologies remain restricted. This review aims to summarize the causal mechanisms across climate extremes considering water quality parameters and Asian water quality modeling methods associated with climate extremes, such as floods and droughts. In this review, we (1) identify current scientific approaches to water quality modeling and prediction in the context of flood and drought assessment, (2) discuss the challenges and impediments, and (3) propose potential solutions to these challenges to improve understanding of the impact of climate extremes on water quality and mitigate their negative impacts. This study emphasizes that one crucial step toward enhancing our aquatic ecosystems is by comprehending the connections between climate extreme events and water quality through collective efforts. The connections between the climate indices and water quality indicators were demonstrated to better understand the link between climate extremes and water quality for a selected watershed basin.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This study aimed to construct a comprehensive explanatory framework for landslide susceptibility evaluation models based on the SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation)-XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm, analyze the regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity of landslide influencing factors, and discuss the heterogeneity of the generalizability of the models under different landscapes. Firstly, we selected different regions in typical mountainous hilly region and constructed a geospatial database containing 12 landslide influencing factors such as elevation, annual average rainfall, slope, lithology, and NDVI through field surveys, satellite images, and a literature review. Subsequently, the landslide susceptibility evaluation model was constructed based on the XGBoost algorithm and spatial database, and the prediction results of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model were explained based on regional topography, geology, and hydrology using the SHAP algorithm. Finally, the model was generalized and applied to regions with both similar and very different topography, geology, meteorology, and vegetation, to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the generalizability of the model. The following conclusions were drawn: the spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous and complex, and the contribution of each influencing factor on the occurrence of landslides has obvious regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity. The generalizability of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model is spatially heterogeneous and has better generalizability to regions with similar regional characteristics. Further explanation of the XGBoost landslide susceptibility evaluation model using the SHAP method allows quantitative analysis of the differences in how much various factors contribute to disasters due to spatial heterogeneity, from the perspective of global and local evaluation units.

Such complex nonlinear processes are challenging to model, predict and optimize using conventional methods. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have gained momentum in offering alternative computational approaches to solve solid waste management (SWM) problems. AI has been efficient at tackling ill-defined problems, learning from experience, and handling uncertainty and incomplete data. Although significant research was carried out in this domain, very few review studies have assessed the potential of AI in solving the diverse SWM problems. This systematic literature review compiled 85 research studies, published between 2004 and 2019, analyzing the application of AI in various SWM fields, including forecasting of waste characteristics, waste bin level detection, process parameters prediction, vehicle routing, and SWM planning. This review provides comprehensive analysis of the different AI models and techniques applied in SWM, application domains and reported performance parameters, as well as the software platforms used to implement such models.

This hinders the design and development of advanced flood prediction models and early warning systems. This paper introduces a multi-modal, sensor-based, near-real-time river monitoring system that produces a multi-feature data set for the Kikuletwa River in Northern Tanzania, an area frequently affected by floods. The system improves upon existing literature by collecting six parameters relevant to weather and river flood detection: current hour rainfall (mm), previous hour rainfall (mm/h), previous day rainfall (mm/day), river level (cm), wind speed (km/h), and wind direction. These data complement the existing local weather station functionalities and can be used for river monitoring and extreme weather prediction. Tanzanian river basins currently lack reliable mechanisms for accurately establishing river thresholds for anomaly detection, which is essential for flood prediction models. The proposed monitoring system addresses this issue by gathering information about river depth levels and weather conditions at multiple locations. This broadens the ground truth of river characteristics, ultimately improving the accuracy of flood predictions. We provide details on the monitoring system used to gather the data, as well as report on the methodology and the nature of the data. The discussion then focuses on the relevance of the data set in the context of flood prediction, the most suitable AI/ML-based forecasting approaches, and highlights potential applications beyond flood warning systems.","We thank the Pangani Water Board (PWB) for allowing us to conduct the study and technical assistance during field activities in the Pangani basin.

Several optimization algorithms have been developed to optimize multi-reservoir systems operation, mostly during severe dry/wet seasons, to mitigate extreme-events consequences. Yet, convergence speed, presence of local optimums, and calculation-cost efficiency are challenging while looking for the global optimum. In this paper, the problem of finding an efficient optimal operation policy in multi-reservoir systems is discussed. The complexity of the long-term operating rules and the reservoirs' upstream and downstream joint-demands projected in recursive constraints make this problem formidable. The original Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) algorithm, which is a meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm, and two modified versions have been used to solve this problem. Proposed modifications reduce the calculation cost by narrowing the search space called a constrained-CCRO and adjusting reproduction operators with a reinforcement learning approach, namely the Q-Learning method (i.e., the CCRO-QL algorithm). The modified versions search for the optimum solution in the feasible region instead of the entire problem domain. The models' performance has been evaluated by solving five mathematical benchmark problems and a well-known continuous four-reservoir system (CFr) problem. Obtained results have been compared with those in the literature and the global optimum, which Linear Programming (LP) achieves. The CCRO-QL is shown to be very calculation-cost-effective in locating the global optimum or near-optimal solutions and efficient in terms of convergence, accuracy, and robustness.","The authors would like to thank Alireza Kazemi (Center for Mind and Brain, Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA) for his valuable suggestions in setting up the Q-Learning method.

By mathematically defining the objective of tasks, we demonstrate that the system can autonomously learn to behave according to its objectives. We applied Q-learning to a peristaltic micropump and showed that two different tasks can be performed on the same platform: adjusting the flow rate of the pump and manipulating the position of the particles. First, we performed typical micropumping with flow rate control. In this task, the system is rewarded according to the deviation between the average flow rate generated by the micropump and the target value. Therefore, the objective of the system is to maintain the target flow rate via an operation of the pump. Next, we demonstrate the micromanipulation of a small object (microbead) on the same platform. The objective was to manipulate the microbead position to the target area, and the system was rewarded for the success of the task. These results confirmed that the system learned to control the flow rate and manipulate the microbead to any randomly chosen target position. In particular, the manipulation technique is a new technology that does not require the use of structures such as wells or weirs.

This paper is concerned with the failure parameters, namely, cohesion and friction angle which are conventionally estimated using Mohr's cycles that are drawn using compressional tests on rock samples. The availability, continuity and representability, and cost of acquiring those samples are major concerns. The objective of this paper is to investigate an alternative technique to estimate these parameters from the drilling data. In this work, more than 2200 data points were used to develop and test the correlations built by the artificial neural network. Each data point comprises the failure parameters and five drilling records that are available instantaneously in drilling rigs such as rate of penetration, weight on bit, and torque. The data were grouped into three datasets, training, testing, and validation with a corresponding percentage of 60/20/20, the former two sets were utilized in the models' building while the last one was hidden as a final check afterward. The models were optimized and evaluated using the correlation coefficient (R) and average absolute percentage error (AAPE). In general, the two models yielded good fits with the actual values. The friction angle model yielded R values around 0.86 and AAPE values around 4% for the three datasets. While the model for cohesion resulted in R values around 0.89 and APPE values around 6%. The equation and the parameters of those models are reported in the paper.

The wetlands of the Yellow River Delta are subject to multiple influences of ocean tidal action and the massive sediment deposits of the Yellow River, resulting in a more complex and unstable composition of land cover types. To better distinguish the wetlands in the region, we conducted the classification using an object-oriented combined with feature preference machine learning approach. To alleviate the pretzel phenomenon in pixel-based classification, a superpixel segmentation method using the watershed algorithm with H-minima labeling was used to segment the images at the optimal scale. The best feature subset for classification was filtered using the recursive feature elimination cross-validation approach, which extracts multiple spectral indices from the images. A random forest classifier combining superpixel segmentation and feature selection methods was proposed for the wetland classification. The model improves the classification accuracy of wetlands compared to three classical pixel-based machine learning classification methods.

Large-scale joint operation of river basins usually needs to consider meteorological and hydrological conditions, historical flood data, multireservoir engineering conditions, and multiple flood control targets, which is a complex decision-making problem. Therefore, electing the optimal operation model of reservoir flood control optimization is very important. In this paper, Luanhe River Basin is taken as the research area, and three kinds of constraints, namely, water balance constraint, reservoir flood control capacity constraint, and water release decision constraint, are set to construct the flood control optimization model. Taking the minimum square of the sum of reservoir discharge and interval flood discharge as the objective function, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Spider swarm optimization (SSO), and grey wolf optimization (GWO) are introduced into flood control optimal operation to seek the minimum value of objective function, and the results are compared and analyzed. Through the analysis of optimization results, the optimization ability and convergence effect of grey wolf optimization algorithm are better than those of genetic algorithm and particle algorithm, and the results are more stable than those of spider swarm algorithm. It has a good model structure and can make full use of the results of three wolf groups for optimization. Through the analysis of scheduling results, the results of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are similar, while those of spider swarm optimization algorithm and grey wolf optimization algorithm are similar and slightly better than those of the first two. Moreover, the search range of grey wolf optimization algorithm for solving long sequence problems is wider and the calculation time is shorter. Therefore, the grey wolf optimization algorithm can be applied to solve the flood control operation optimization model of Panjiakou Reservoir Group.",The authors would like to show sincere thanks to those technicians who have contributed to this research.

This could pose significant operational risks, such as well control, stuck pipe, and wellbore instability, which, in turn, lead to an increase in well time and cost. This research aims to use and evaluate different machine learning techniques, namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K nearest neighbor (K-NN) in predicting the loss of circulation rate (LCR) while drilling using solely mechanical surface parameters and interpretation of the active pit volume readings. Actual field data of seven wells, which had suffered partial or severe loss of circulation, were used to build predictive models with an 80:20 training-to-test data ratio, while Well No. 8 was used to compare the performance of the developed models. Different performance metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the developed models. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting the LCR while drilling. The results showed that K-NN outperformed other models in predicting the LCR in Well No. 8 with an R of 0.90 and an RMSE of 0.17.","The authors thank Saudi Aramco and King Fahad University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals (KFUPM) for supporting, employing resources, and granting permission to publish the research.",This research received no external funding.,ACS Omega,,,2022-06-08,2022,2022-06-08,2022-06-21,7,24,20696-20709,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alsaihati, Ahmed; Abughaban, Mahmoud; Elkatatny, Salaheldin; Shehri, Dhafer Al","Alsaihati, Ahmed (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum &Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.); Abughaban, Mahmoud (Drilling Technology Division, EXPEC Advanced Research Center, Dhahran 34466, Saudi Arabia.); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum &Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.); Shehri, Dhafer Al (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum &Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Alsaihati, Ahmed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Abughaban, Mahmoud (); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Shehri, Dhafer Al (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",2,2,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9218981,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148520882,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

AI may contribute (i) to diagnosis and disease case detection, (ii) to more reliable predictions and reduced errors, (iii) to representing more realistically complex biological systems and rendering computing codes more readable to non-computer scientists, (iv) to speeding-up decisions and improving accuracy in risk analyses, and (v) to better targeted interventions and anticipated negative effects. In turn, challenges in AH may stimulate AI research due to specificity of AH systems, data, constraints, and analytical objectives. Based on a literature review of scientific papers at the interface between AI and AH covering the period 2009–2019, and interviews with French researchers positioned at this interface, the present study explains the main AH areas where various AI approaches are currently mobilised, how it may contribute to renew AH research issues and remove methodological or conceptual barriers. After presenting the possible obstacles and levers, we propose several recommendations to better grasp the challenge represented by the AH/AI interface. With the development of several recent concepts promoting a global and multisectoral perspective in the field of health, AI should contribute to defract the different disciplines in AH towards more transversal and integrative research.","This work has benefited from interactions with many French researchers (Additional file 1B) interested in the AI/AH interface, for which we thank them here.

Accurate detection of macroplastic litter (plastic items >5 mm) in water is essential to estimate the quantities, compositions and sources, identify emerging trends, and design preventive measures or mitigation strategies. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated the potential of computer vision (CV) techniques based on deep learning (DL) for automated detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies. However, a systematic review to describe the state-of-the-art of the field is lacking. Here we provide such a review, and we highlight current knowledge gaps and suggest promising future research directions. The review compares 34 papers with respect to their application and modeling related criteria. The results show that the researchers have employed a variety of DL architectures implementing different CV techniques to detect macroplastic litter in various aquatic environments. However, key knowledge gaps must be addressed to overcome the lack of: (i) DL-based macroplastic litter detection models with sufficient generalization capability, (ii) DL-based quantification of macroplastic (mass) fluxes and hotspots and (iii) scalable macroplastic litter monitoring strategies based on robust DL-based quantification. We advocate for the exploration of data-centric artificial intelligence approaches and semi-supervised learning to develop models with improved generalization capabilities. These models can boost the development of new methods for the quantification of macroplastic (mass) fluxes and hotspots, and allow for structural monitoring strategies that leverage robust DL-based quantification. While the identified gaps concern all bodies of water, we recommend increased efforts with respect to riverine ecosystems, considering their major role in transport and storage of litter.",The work is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 202006160032) and the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management of The Netherlands (Rijkswaterstaat).

Northern Pakistan's Potwar Basin is located in the foreland and thrust bands of the Himalayan mountains. The current research aims to delineate the hydrocarbon potential, reservoir zone evaluation, and lithofacies identification through the utilization of seven conventional well logs (M-01, M-08, M-10, M-12, M-13P, and M-17). We employed the advanced unsupervised machine-learning method of self-organizing maps for lithofacies identification and the novel Quanti Elan model technique for comprehensive multimineral evaluation. The shale volume, porosity, permeability, and water saturation (petrophysical parameters) of six wells were evaluated to identify the reservoir potential and prospective reservoir zones. Well-logging data and self-organizing maps were used in this study to provide a less costly method for the objective and systematic identification of lithofacies. According to the SOM and Pickett plot analyses, the zone of interest is mostly made up of pure limestone oil zone, whereas the sandy and dolomitic behavior with a mixture of shale content shows non-reservoir oil-water and water zones. The reservoir has good porosity values that range from 0 to 18%, but there is a high water saturation of up to 45% in reservoir production zones. The presence of shale in the entire reservoir interval has a negative effect on the permeability value, but the petrophysical properties of the Meyal oil reservoir are good enough to permit hydrocarbon production. According to the petrophysical estimates, the Meyal oil field's Sakesar and Chorgali Formations are promising reservoirs, and new prospects for drilling wells in the southern and central portions of the eastern portion of the research area are recommended.","The authors thank the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions (DGPC), Pakistan, for the release of well data.

During the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a constant reminder of about the importance of hygiene and sanitation for public health. The most common approach to securing clean water supplies for this purpose is via wastewater treatment. To date, an effective method of detecting wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) accurately and automatically via remote sensing is unavailable. In this paper, we provide a solution to this task by proposing a novel joint deep learning (JDL) method that consists of a fine-tuned object detection network and a multi-task residual attention network (RAN). By leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) and multimodal remote sensing (RS) data, our JDL method is able to simultaneously tackle two different tasks: land use land cover (LULC) and WWTP classification. Moreover, JDL exploits the complementary effects between these tasks for a performance gain. We train JDL using 4,187 WWTP features and 4,200 LULC samples and validate the performance of the proposed method over a selected area around Stuttgart with 723 WWTP features and 1,200 LULC samples to generate an LULC classification map and a WWTP detection map. Extensive experiments conducted with different comparative methods demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our JDL method in automatic WWTP detection in comparison with single-modality/single-task or traditional survey methods. Moreover, lessons learned pave the way for future works to simultaneously and effectively address multiple large-scale mapping tasks (e.g., both mapping LULC and detecting WWTP) from multimodal RS data via deep learning.",,,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,,,2022-05-15,2022,2022-05-15,2022-06,110,,102804,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Hao; Zech, Johannes; Hong, Danfeng; Ghamisi, Pedram; Schultz, Michael; Zipf, Alexander","Li, Hao (GIScience Chair, Institute of Geography, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.); Zech, Johannes (GIScience Chair, Institute of Geography, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.); Hong, Danfeng (Key Laboratory of Computational Optical Imaging Technology, Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100094, China.); Ghamisi, Pedram (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Machine Learning Group, D-09599 Freiberg, Saxony, Germany.; Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI), Landstraßer Hauptstraße 5, 1030 Vienna, Austria.); Schultz, Michael (GIScience Chair, Institute of Geography, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.); Zipf, Alexander (GIScience Chair, Institute of Geography, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; HeiGIT at Heidelberg University, Schloss-Wolfsbrunnenweg 33, 69118Heidelberg, Germany.)","Li, Hao (Heidelberg University)","Li, Hao (Heidelberg University); Zech, Johannes (Heidelberg University); Hong, Danfeng (Aerospace Information Research Institute); Ghamisi, Pedram (Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology; Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence); Schultz, Michael (Heidelberg University); Zipf, Alexander (Heidelberg University; Heidelberg University)",5,5,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102804,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147896832,40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering,15 Life on Land; 6 Clean Water and Sanitation

As the coronavirus continues spreading, researchers are concerned by providing or help provide solutions to save lives and to stop the pandemic outbreak. Among others, artificial intelligence (AI) has been adapted to address the challenges caused by pandemic. In this article, we design a deep learning system to extract features and detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Three powerful networks, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG16, have been fine-tuned on an enhanced dataset, which was constructed by collecting COVID-19 and normal chest X-ray images from different public databases. We applied data augmentation techniques to artificially generate a large number of chest X-ray images: Random Rotation with an angle between − 10 and 10 degrees, random noise, and horizontal flips. Experimental results are encouraging: the proposed models reached an accuracy of 97.20 % for Resnet50, 98.10 % for InceptionV3, and 98.30 % for VGG16 in classifying chest X-ray images as Normal or COVID-19. The results show that transfer learning is proven to be effective, showing strong performance and easy-to-deploy COVID-19 detection methods. This enables automatizing the process of analyzing X-ray images with high accuracy and it can also be used in cases where the materials and RT-PCR tests are limited.",,,Multimedia Tools and Applications,,,2021-07-19,2021,2021-07-19,2021-09,80,21-23,31803-31820,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Guefrechi, Sarra; Jabra, Marwa Ben; Ammar, Adel; Koubaa, Anis; Hamam, Habib","Guefrechi, Sarra (Faculty of Engineering, University of Moncton, Moncton, NB, Canada); Jabra, Marwa Ben (Charisma University, British Overseas Territories, Englewood, UK; Robotics and Internet- of-Things Unit (RIoT) Lab, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia); Ammar, Adel (Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia); Koubaa, Anis (Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Gaitech Robotics, Shanghai, China; INESC- TEC, ISEP, Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal); Hamam, Habib (Faculty of Engineering, University of Moncton, Moncton, NB, Canada)","Guefrechi, Sarra (Université de Moncton)","Guefrechi, Sarra (Université de Moncton); Jabra, Marwa Ben (); Ammar, Adel (Prince Sultan University); Koubaa, Anis (Prince Sultan University); Hamam, Habib (Université de Moncton)",18,18,2.39,14.29,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11042-021-11192-5.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139783380,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

In this study, we introduce a framework that accurately predicts effective reaction rates directly from pore structural features by combining 3D pore-scale numerical simulations with machine learning (ML). We first perform pore-scale reactive transport simulations with fluid–solid reactions in hundreds of porous media and calculate effective reaction rates from pore-scale concentration fields. We then train a Random Forests model with 11 pore structural features and effective reaction rates to quantify the importance of structural features in determining effective reaction rates. Based on the importance information, we train artificial neural networks with varying number of features and demonstrate that effective reaction rates can be accurately predicted with only three pore structural features, which are specific surface, pore sphericity, and coordination number. Finally, global sensitivity analyses using the ML model elucidates how the three structural features affect effective reaction rates. The proposed framework enables accurate predictions of effective reaction rates directly from a few measurable pore structural features, and the framework is readily applicable to a wide range of applications involving porous media flows.",Peter K.

Simulating transient pressures using traditional numerical methods, however, require a complete model with known boundary and initial conditions, which is rarely able to obtain in a real system. This paper proposes a new physics-based and data-driven method for targeted transient pressure reconstruction without the need of having a complete pipe system model. The new method formulates a physics-informed neural network (PINN) by incorporating both measured data and physical laws of the transient flow in the training process. This enables the PINN to learn and explore hidden information of the hydraulic transient (e.g., boundary conditions and wave damping characteristics) that is embedded in the measured data. The trained PINN can then be used to predict transient pressures at any location of the pipeline. Results from two numerical and one experimental case studies showed a high accuracy of the pressure reconstruction using the proposed approach. In addition, a series of sensitivity analyses have been conducted to determine the optimal hyperparameters in the PINN and to understand the effects of the sensor configuration on the model performance.",This research is funded by the Australian Research Council through the Discovery Project Grant DP210103565.

Despite their higher accuracy, existing regression models fail to highlight the feature importance or causality of the respective predictions. Therefore, we propose a method to predict UB and the friction factor in the surface layer (fS) using tree-based machine learning (ML) models (decision tree, extra tree, and XGBoost). Further, Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) was used to interpret the ML predictions. The comparison emphasized that the XGBoost model is superior in predicting UB (R = 0.984) and fS (R = 0.92) relative to the existing regression models. SHAP revealed the underlying reasoning behind predictions, the dependence of predictions, and feature importance. Interestingly, SHAP adheres to what is generally observed in complex flow behavior, thus, improving trust in predictions.",We thank the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Moratuwa for facilitating the data analysis.,This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning,2022-06-10,2022,2022-06-10,,22,12,4398,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meddage, D.

Therefore, numerous attempts have been made using several approaches (such as regressions and machine learning) to accurately develop models for predicting the Pb. However, some previous models did not study the trend analysis to prove the correct relationships between inputs and outputs to show the proper physical behavior. Thus, this study aims to build a robust and more accurate model to predict the Pb using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and trend analysis approaches for the first time. More than 700 global datasets have been used to develop and validate the model to robustly and accurately predict the Pb. The proposed ANFIS model is compared with 21 existing models using statistical error analysis such as correlation coefficient (R), standard deviation (SD), average absolute percentage relative error (AAPRE), average percentage relative error (APRE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The ANFIS model shows the proper relationships between independent and dependent parameters that indicate the correct physical behavior. The ANFIS model outperformed all 21 models with the highest R of 0.994 and the lowest AAPRE, APRE, SD, and RMSE of 6.38%, -0.99%, 0.074 psi, and 9.73 psi, respectively, as the first rank model. The second rank model has the R, AAPRE, APRE, SD, and RMSE of 0.9724, 9%, -1.58%, 0.095 psi, and 13.04 psi, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed ANFIS model is validated to follow the correct physical behavior with higher accuracy than all studied models.","Special thanks to the Centre of Research in Enhanced Oil Recovery (COREOR), Petroleum Engineering department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS for supporting this work.","The authors would like to give their heartfelt thanks to the Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (YUTP FRG Grant No: 015LC0-226) at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS for supporting this study.

Moreover, measurement of the RI of hemoglobin in the laboratory is time-consuming and expensive; thus, developing a smart approach to estimate this parameter is necessary. In this research, four viable strategies were used to make a quantitative correlation between the RI of hemoglobin and its influencing parameters including the concentration, wavelength, and temperature. First, alternating conditional expectations (ACE), a statistical approach, was employed to generate a correlation to predict the RI of hemoglobin. Then, three different optimized intelligent techniques-optimized neural network (ONN), optimized fuzzy inference system (OFIS), and optimized support vector regression (OSVR)-were used to model the RI. A bat-inspired (BA) algorithm was embedded in the formulation of intelligent models to obtain the optimal values of weights and biases of an artificial neural network, membership functions of the fuzzy inference system, and free parameters of support vector regression. The coefficient of determination, root-mean-square error, average absolute relative error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error for each of the ACE, ONN, OFIS, and OSVR were found as the measure of each model's accuracy. Results showed that ACE and optimized models (ONN, OFIS, and OSVR) have promising results in the estimation of hemoglobin's RI. Collectively, ACE outperformed ONN, OFIS, and OSVR, while sensitivity analysis indicated that the concentration, wavelength, and, lastly, temperature would have the highest impact on the RI.","The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to respected reviewers who took their time to review this manuscript meticulously and provided us with constructive comments in two rounds.

This study focuses on the prediction of water quality parameters such as the dissolved oxygen (DO) in a river system. The accuracy of traditional water quality prediction methods is generally low, and the prediction results have serious autocorrelation. To overcome nonstationarity, randomness, and nonlinearity of the water quality parameter data, an improved least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model was proposed to improve the model’s performance at two gaging stations, namely Panzhihua and Jiujiang, in the Yangtze River, China. In addition, a hybrid model that recruits variational mode decomposition (VMD) to denoise the input data was adopted. A novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) was also implemented to compute the optimal parameter values for the LSSVM model. To validate the proposed hybrid model, standalone LSSVM, SSA-LSSVM, VMD-LSSVM, support vector regression (SVR), as well as back propagation neural network (BPNN) were considered as the benchmark models. The results indicated that the VMD-SSA-LSSVM model exhibited the best forecasting performance among all the peer models at Panzhihua station. Furthermore, the model forecasting results applied at Jiujiang were consistent with those at Panzhihua station. This result further verified the accuracy and stability of the VMD-SSA-LSSVM model. Thus, the proposed hybrid model was effective method for forecasting nonstationary and nonlinear water quality parameter series and can be recommended as a promising model for water quality parameter forecasting.",The authors would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that greatly contributed to improving the manuscript.,,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,Algorithms; China; Environmental Monitoring; Least-Squares Analysis; Rivers; Support Vector Machine; Water Quality,2021-05-27,2021,2021-05-27,2021-06,193,6,363,Closed,Article,"Song, Chenguang; Yao, Leihua; Hua, Chengya; Ni, Qihang","Song, Chenguang (School of Engineering and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 100083, Beijing, China); Yao, Leihua (School of Engineering and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 100083, Beijing, China); Hua, Chengya (School of Engineering and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 100083, Beijing, China); Ni, Qihang (School of Engineering and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), 100083, Beijing, China)","Song, Chenguang (China University of Geosciences); Yao, Leihua (China University of Geosciences)","Song, Chenguang (China University of Geosciences); Yao, Leihua (China University of Geosciences); Hua, Chengya (China University of Geosciences); Ni, Qihang (China University of Geosciences)",33,33,3.75,13.04,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138365871,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 40 Engineering,

Evapotranspiration is an important quantity required in many applications, such as hydrology and agricultural and irrigation planning. Reference evapotranspiration is particularly important, and the prediction of its variations is beneficial for analyzing the needs and management of water resources. In this paper, we explore the predictive ability of hybrid ensemble learning to predict daily reference evapotranspiration (RET) under the semi-arid climate by using meteorological datasets at 12 locations in the Andalusia province in southern Spain. The datasets comprise mean, maximum, and minimum air temperatures and mean relative humidity and mean wind speed. A new modified variant of the grey wolf optimizer, named the PRSFGWO algorithm, is proposed to maximize the ensemble learning’s prediction accuracy through optimal weight tuning and evaluate the proposed model’s capacity when the climate data is limited. The performance of the proposed approach, based on weighted ensemble learning, is compared with various algorithms commonly adopted in relevant studies. A diverse set of statistical measurements alongside ANOVA tests was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the prediction models. The proposed model showed high-accuracy statistics, with relative root mean errors lower than 0.999% and a minimum R2 of 0.99. The model inputs were also reduced from six variables to only two for cost-effective predictions of daily RET. This shows that the PRSFGWO algorithm is a good RET prediction model for the semi-arid climate region in southern Spain. The results obtained from this research are very promising compared with existing models in the literature.",The authors acknowledge the Agroclimatic-Information-Network of Andalusia (RIA) in providing the most used data.,This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through PTDC/CTA-OHR/30561/2017 (WinTherface).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Wind; Desert Climate; Water Resources; Hydrology; Machine Learning,2022-06-22,2022,2022-06-22,2022-11,29,54,81279-81299,Closed,Article,"El-kenawy, El-Sayed M.; Zerouali, Bilel; Bailek, Nadjem; Bouchouich, Kada; Hassan, Muhammed A.; Almorox, Javier; Kuriqi, Alban; Eid, Marwa; Ibrahim‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬, Abdelhameed","El-kenawy, El-Sayed M.

Their development gave rise to the exploration of new questions, such as what made brains reliable (since neurons can die) and how computers could get inspiration from neural systems. In parallel, the first artificial neural networks came to life. Since then, the comparative view between brains and computers has been developed in new, sometimes unexpected directions. With the rise of deep learning and the development of connectomics, an evolutionary look at how both hardware and neural complexity have evolved or designed is required. In this paper, we argue that important similarities have resulted both from convergent evolution (the inevitable outcome of architectural constraints) and inspiration of hardware and software principles guided by toy pictures of neurobiology. Moreover, dissimilarities and gaps originate from the lack of major innovations that have paved the way to biological computing (including brains) that are completely absent within the artificial domain. As it occurs within synthetic biocomputation, we can also ask whether alternative minds can emerge from A.I. designs. Here, we take an evolutionary view of the problem and discuss the remarkable convergences between living and artificial designs and what are the pre-conditions to achieve artificial intelligence.","R Solé thanks Xerxes Arsiwalla, Jordi Delgado, Gemma de las Cuevas, Marti Sanchez-Fibla, Patrick Fraser and Jordi Piñero for useful discussions about brains and minds.

PINNs are based on simple architectures, and learn the behavior of complex physical systems by optimizing the network parameters to minimize the residual of the underlying PDE. Current network architectures share some of the limitations of classical numerical discretization schemes when applied to non-linear differential equations in continuum mechanics. A paradigmatic example is the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws that develop highly localized nonlinear shock waves. Learning solutions of PDEs with dominant hyperbolic character is a challenge for current PINN approaches, which rely, like most grid-based numerical schemes, on adding artificial dissipation. Here, we address the fundamental question of which network architectures are best suited to learn the complex behavior of non-linear PDEs. We focus on network architecture rather than on residual regularization. Our new methodology, called physics-informed attention-based neural networks (PIANNs), is a combination of recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms. The attention mechanism adapts the behavior of the deep neural network to the non-linear features of the solution, and break the current limitations of PINNs. We find that PIANNs effectively capture the shock front in a hyperbolic model problem, and are capable of providing high-quality solutions inside the convex hull of the training set.",,,Scientific Reports,,"Neural Networks, Computer; Physics",2022-05-09,2022,2022-05-09,,12,1,7557,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodriguez-Torrado, Ruben; Ruiz, Pablo; Cueto-Felgueroso, Luis; Green, Michael Cerny; Friesen, Tyler; Matringe, Sebastien; Togelius, Julian","Rodriguez-Torrado, Ruben (OriGen.AI, New York, USA; Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; New York University, New York, USA); Ruiz, Pablo (OriGen.AI, New York, USA); Cueto-Felgueroso, Luis (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain); Green, Michael Cerny (OriGen.AI, New York, USA); Friesen, Tyler (OriGen.AI, New York, USA); Matringe, Sebastien (Hess Corporation, Houston, TX, USA); Togelius, Julian (OriGen.AI, New York, USA; New York University, New York, USA)","Rodriguez-Torrado, Ruben (Amnesty International USA; Technical University of Madrid; New York University)","Rodriguez-Torrado, Ruben (Amnesty International USA; Technical University of Madrid; New York University); Ruiz, Pablo (Amnesty International USA); Cueto-Felgueroso, Luis (Technical University of Madrid); Green, Michael Cerny (Amnesty International USA); Friesen, Tyler (Amnesty International USA); Matringe, Sebastien (); Togelius, Julian (Amnesty International USA; New York University)",13,13,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11058-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147729974,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

Until now, however, these artificial intelligence techniques have fallen short of discovering the full differential equation of an experimental physical system. Here we show that a dynamical neural network, trained on a minimal amount of data, can predict the behavior of spintronic devices with high accuracy and an extremely efficient simulation time, compared to the micromagnetic simulations that are usually employed to model them. For this purpose, we re-frame the formalism of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to the constraints of spintronics: few measured outputs, multiple inputs and internal parameters. We demonstrate with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations an acceleration factor over 200 compared to micromagnetic simulations for a complex problem – the simulation of a reservoir computer made of magnetic skyrmions (20 minutes compared to three days). In a second realization, we show that we can predict the noisy response of experimental spintronic nano-oscillators to varying inputs after training Neural Ordinary Differential Equations on five milliseconds of their measured response to a different set of inputs. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can therefore constitute a disruptive tool for developing spintronic applications in complement to micromagnetic simulations, which are time-consuming and cannot fit experiments when noise or imperfections are present. Our approach can also be generalized to other electronic devices involving dynamics.","This work was supported by European Research Council Starting Grant NANOINFER (reference: 715872) and BIOSPINSPIRED (reference: 682955).

Feature importance of the prediction model was consistent with key pollution indicators. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the significance level of the variation trends of different pollution indicators. The results show that the total phosphorus (TOP), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and petroleum (PET) among the key pollution indicators were on an upward trend in the study area.

During the model building process, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to offer a complementary and computationally efficient tool for the physics-driven model, and the von Bertalanffy performance indicator is used to bridge the physics-driven model with the ANN. After that, the accuracy of the model is validated by blind-testing cases. Average absolute percentage error of related parameters of the performance indicator in the testing data set is 0.77%, and the error of Cum-oil production after 20 years is 0.52%. The results illustrate that the integration of performance indicator and ANN makes it possible to solve time series problems in an efficient way. Besides, the data-driven proxy model could be applied to fast parametric studies, quick uncertainty analysis with the Monte Carlo method, and average daily oil production prediction. The findings of this study could help for better understanding of combination of physics-driven model and data-driven model and illustrate the potential for application of the data-driven proxy model to help reservoir engineers, making better use of this significant thermal recovery technology for oil sands or heavy oil reservoirs.","The authors would like to acknowledge Computer Modeling Group (CMG) Company for providing the academic licenses for STARS and also want to acknowledge the open source platform named PyTorch.

Affected by rainfall and cyclic fluctuations in reservoir water levels, a large number of landslide disasters have developed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. In this article, the Baishuihe landslide was taken as the research object. Firstly, based on time series theory, the landslide displacement was decomposed into three parts (trend term, periodic term, and random term) by Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). Next, the landslide was divided into three deformation states according to the deformation rate. A data mining algorithm was introduced for selecting the triggering factors of periodic displacement, and the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm-Back Propagation Neural Network (FOA-BPNN) was applied to the training and prediction of periodic and random displacements. The results show that the displacement monitoring curve of the Baishuihe landslide has a ""step-like"" trend. Using VMD to decompose the displacement of a landslide can indicate the triggering factors, which has clear physical significance. In the proposed model, the R2 values between the measured and predicted displacements of ZG118 and XD01 were 0.977 and 0.978 respectively.

Intensive water-quality, hydrodynamic, and meteorological data were used to train and validate both ANN and SVM models. The Latin-hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) method and a pattern search algorithm were applied to perform sensitivity analyses for the input variables and to optimize the parameters of the models, respectively. The results indicated that the two models well reproduced the algae alert level based on the time-lag input and output data. In particular, the ANN model showed a better performance than the SVM model, displaying a higher performance value in both training and validation steps. Furthermore, a sampling frequency of 6- and 7-day were determined as efficient early-warning intervals for the freshwater reservoir.

Due to limited historical data for drought monitoring and forecasting available in the central India of Maharashtra state, implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms could allow for the prediction of future drought events. In this paper, we have focused on the prediction accuracy of meteorological drought in the semi-arid region based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI) using the random forest (RF), random tree (RT), and Gaussian process regression (GPR-PUK kernel) models. A different combination of machine learning models and variables has been performed for the forecasting of metrological drought based on the SPI-6 and 12 months. Models were developed using monthly rainfall data for the period of 2000–2019 at two meteorological stations, namely, Karanjali and Gangawdi, each representing a geographical region of Upper Godavari river basin area in the central India of Maharashtra state which frequently experiences droughts. Historical data from the SPI from 2000 to 2013 was processed to train the model into machine learning model, and the rest of the 2014 to 2019-year data were used for testing to forecast the SPI and metrological drought. The mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), adjusted R2, Mallows’ (Cp), Akaike’s (AIC), Schwarz’s (SBC), and Amemiya’s PC were used to identify the best combination input model and best subregression analysis for both stations of SPI-6 and 12.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This study aimed to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting LTBI from body weight and other host-related disease risk factors. We used datasets from participants of the US-National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2012; n=5,156; 514 with LTBI and 4,642 controls) to develop three ANNs employing body mass index (BMI, Network I), BMI and HbA1C (as a proxy for diabetes; Network II) and BMI, HbA1C and education (as a proxy for socioeconomic status; Network III). The models were trained on n=1018 age- and sex-matched subjects equally distributed between the control and LTBI groups. The endpoint was the prediction of LTBI.
RESULTS: When data was adjusted for age, sex, diabetes and level of education, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk of LTBI with increased BMI was 0.85 (95%CI: 0.77 - 0.96, p=0.01). The three ANNs had a predictive accuracy varied from 75 to 80% with sensitivities ranged from 85% to 94% and specificities of approximately 70%. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were between 0.82 and 0.87. Optimal ANN performance was noted using BMI as a risk indicator.
CONCLUSION: Body weight can be employed in developing artificial intelligence-based tool to predict LTBI. This can be useful in precise decision making in clinical and public health practices aiming to curb the burden of tuberculosis, e.g., in the management and monitoring of the tuberculosis prevention programs and to evaluate the impact of healthy weight on tuberculosis risk and burden.",,,Journal of Public Health Research,,,2021-01-14,2021,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,10,1,1985,All OA; Gold,Article,"Badawi, Alaa; Liu, Christina J.; Rihem, Anas A.; Gupta, Alind","Badawi, Alaa (Public Health Risk Sciences Division, Public Health Agency of Canada, Toronto; Department of Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto); Liu, Christina J.

It is affected by several factors which are inseparable. Current established models for determining the ROP include the basic mathematical and physics equations, as well as the use of empirical correlations. Given the complexity of the drilling process, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been a game changer because most of the unknown parameters can now be accounted for entirely at the modeling process. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the ability of the optimized adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), functional neural networks (FN), random forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models to predict the ROP in real time from the drilling parameters in the S-shape well profile, for the first time, based on the drilling parameters of weight on bit (WOB), drillstring rotation (DSR), torque (T), pumping rate (GPM), and standpipe pressure (SPP). Data from two wells were used for training and testing (Well A and Well B with 4012 and 1717 data points, respectively), and one well for validation (Well C) with 2500 data points. Well A and Well B data were combined in the training-testing phase and were randomly divided into a 70:30 ratio for training/testing. The results showed that the ANFIS, FN, and RF models could effectively predict the ROP from the drilling parameters in the S-shape well profile, while the accuracy of the SVM model was very low. The ANFIS, FN, and RF models predicted the ROP for the training data with average absolute percentage errors (AAPEs) of 9.50%, 13.44%, and 3.25%, respectively. For the testing data, the ANFIS, FN, and RF models predicted the ROP with AAPEs of 9.57%, 11.20%, and 8.37%, respectively.

Owing to its ingrained capability of performing high-speed and low-cost computations this has become a panacea for multi-variate complex systems having non-linearity within their relationships. Modelling economic and financial trends has always been a challenging task owing to their volatile nature and no linear dependence on associated influencers. Prior studies aimed at effectively forecasting such financial systems, but, always left a visible room for optimization in terms of cost, speed and modelling complexities. Our work employs a reservoir computing approach complying to echo-state network principles, along with varying strengths of time-delayed feedback to model a complex financial system. The derived model is demonstrated to act robustly towards influence of trends and other fluctuating parameters by effectively forecasting long-term system behavior. Moreover, it also re-generates the financial system unknowns with a high degree of accuracy when only limited future data is available, thereby, becoming a reliable feeder for any long-term decision making or policy formulations.","This research was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, India under DU-DST Purse Phase-II (Grant#381/382/22-09-2015; https://dst.gov.in/).

In this sense, there is a need to control the formation of these depositions to evaluate preventive and corrective measures regarding the waste management of these materials, as well as the optimization of oil extraction and transport processes. Noninvasive techniques such as gamma transmission and scattering can support the determination of the thickness of these deposits in pipes. This paper presents a novel methodology for prediction of scale with eccentric deposition in pipes used in the offshore oil industry and its approach is based on the principles of gamma densitometry and deep artificial neural networks (DNNs). To determine deposition thicknesses, a detection system has been developed that utilizes a 1 mm narrow beam geometry of collimation aperture comprising a source of 137Cs and three properly positioned 2″×2″ NaI(Tl) detectors around the system, pipe-scale-fluid. Crude oil was considered in the study, as well as eccentric deposits formed by barium sulfate, BaSO4. The theoretical models adopted a static flow regime and were developed using the MCNPX mathematical code and, secondly, used for the training and testing of the developed DNN model, a 7-layers deep rectifier neural network (DRNN). In addition, the hyperparameters of the DRNN were defined using a Baysian optimization method and its performance was validated via 10 experiments based on the K-Fold cross-validation technique. Following the proposed methodology, the DRNN was able to achieve, for the test sets (untrained samples), an average mean absolute error of 0.01734, mean absolute relative error of 0.29803% and R2 Score of 0.9998813 for the scale thickness prediction and an average accuracy of 100% for the scale position prediction. Therefore, the results show that the 7-layers DRNN presents good generalization capacity and is able to predict scale thickness with great precision, regardless of its position inside the tube.",The authors would like to acknowledge: the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and Petrobras for financial support.

Due to climate changes, low quality of construction material, large flow of traffic, and heavy vehicles, road surface anomalies are increasing rapidly. Detection and repairing of these defects are necessary for the safety of drivers, passengers, and vehicles from mechanical faults. In this modern era, autonomous vehicles are an active research area that controls itself with the help of in-vehicle sensors without human commands, especially after the emergence of deep learning (DNN) techniques. A combination of sensors and DNN techniques can be useful for unmanned vehicles for the perception of their surroundings for the detection of tracks and obstacles for smooth traveling based on the deployment of artificial intelligence in vehicles. One of the biggest challenges for autonomous vehicles is to avoid the critical road defects that may lead to dangerous situations. To solve the accident issues and share emergency information, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) introduced the concept of vehicular network termed as vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) for achieving security and safety in a traffic flow. A novel mechanism is proposed for the automatic detection of road anomalies by autonomous vehicles and providing road information to upcoming vehicles based on Edge AI and VANET. Road images captured via camera and deployment of the trained model for road anomaly detection in a vehicle could help to reduce the accident rate and risk of hazards on poor road conditions. The techniques Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-18) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG-11) are applied for the automatic detection and classification of the road with anomalies such as a pothole, bump, crack, and plain roads without anomalies using the dataset from different online sources. The results show that the applied models performed well than other techniques used for road anomalies identification.",,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,"Accidents, Traffic; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Transportation",2021-09-29,2021,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,2021,,6262194,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bibi, Rozi; Saeed, Yousaf; Zeb, Asim; Ghazal, Taher M.; Rahman, Taj; Said, Raed A.; Abbas, Sagheer; Ahmad, Munir; Khan, Muhammad Adnan","Bibi, Rozi (Department of Information Technology, The University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan, uoh.edu.pk); Saeed, Yousaf (Department of Information Technology, The University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan, uoh.edu.pk); Zeb, Asim (Department of Computer Science, Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Havelian, Pakistan, aust.edu.pk); Ghazal, Taher M.

However, water quality monitoring in inland waters by satellite remote sensing remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and instrumental resolution limitations. We propose the concept of proximal remote sensing for monitoring water quality. The proximal hyperspectral imager, developed by Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Hikvision Digital Technology, Ltd., is a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution (1 nm) sensor for continuous observation, allowing for effective and practical long-term monitoring of inland water quality. In this study, machine learning and empirical algorithms were developed and validated using in situ total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and spectral reflectance from Lake Taihu (N = 171), the Liangxi River (N = 94) and the Fuchunjiang Reservoir (N = 109) covering different water quality. Our dataset includes a large range for three key water quality parameters of TN from 0.93 to 6.46 mg/L, TP from 0.04 to 0.62 mg/L, and COD from 1.32 to 15.41 mg/L. Overall, the back-propagation (BP) neural network model had an accuracy of over 80% for TN (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.33 mg/L, and MRE = 11.4%) and over 90% for TP (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.02 mg/L, and MRE = 12.4%) and COD (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.66 mg/L, and MRE = 9.3%). Our results show that proximal remote sensing combined with machine learning algorithms has great potential for monitoring water quality in inland waters.","This study was supported by the Scientific Instrument Developing Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (YJKYYQ20200071), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41930760 and 41807362), and Water Resource Science and Technology Project in Jiangsu Province (2020057).

The remarkable increase in the use of social media as a critical source of information combined with the shaking of trust in traditional media, the high speed of digital news dissemination, and the vast amount of information circulating on the Internet have exacerbated the problem of so-called fake news. The present work proves the importance of detecting fake news by taking advantage of the information derived from friendships between users. Specifically, using an innovative deep temporal convolutional network (DTCN) scheme assisted using the tensor factorization non-negative RESCAL method, we take advantage of class-aware rate tables during and not after the factorization process, producing more accurate representations to detect fake news with exceptionally high reliability. In this way, the need to develop automated methods for detecting false information is demonstrated with the primary aim of protecting readers from misinformation.","This work was a project supported by Hunan Provincial Social Science Fund “Research on Translation of Miao Culture Classics in Western Hunan Area under the Perspective of Cultural Anthropology” (Grant no. 18ZDB005), also by Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department “A study on the English Translation of Hmong Epics from the Perspective of Ethnographic Thick Translation” (Grant no. 19B130); by First -Class Undergraduate Major in Hunan Province ----Business English (Grant No. (2020)179).",,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Communication; Deep Learning; Disinformation; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Social Media,2022-04-28,2022,2022-04-28,2022-04-28,2022,,1493493,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wu, Fei; Luo, Xiaoyu","Wu, Fei (Hunan Institute of Engineering, 411104 Xiangtan, Hunan, China, hnie.edu.cn); Luo, Xiaoyu (Hunan University of Technology and Business, 410205 Changsha, Hunan, China, hutb.edu.cn)","Luo, Xiaoyu (Hunan University of Technology)","Wu, Fei (Hunan Institute of Engineering); Luo, Xiaoyu (Hunan University of Technology)",0,0,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/1493493.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147478816,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Such a requirement is more urgent for landslides in the reservoir area. The main reason is that an inaccurate prediction can lead to riverine disasters and secondary surge disasters. Machine learning (ML) methods have been developed and commonly applied in landslide displacement prediction because of their powerful nonlinear processing ability. Recently, deep ML methods have become popular, as they can deal with more complicated problems than conventional ML methods. However, it is usually not easy to obtain a well-trained deep ML model, as many hyperparameters need to be trained. In this paper, a deep ML method-the gated recurrent unit (GRU)-with the advantages of a powerful prediction ability and fewer hyperparameters, was applied to forecast landslide displacement in the dam reservoir. The accumulated displacement was firstly decomposed into a trend term, a periodic term, and a stochastic term by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). A univariate GRU model and a multivariable GRU model were employed to forecast trend and stochastic displacements, respectively. A multivariable GRU model was applied to predict periodic displacement, and another two popular ML methods-long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) and random forest (RF)-were used for comparison. Precipitation, reservoir level, and previous displacement were considered to be candidate-triggering factors for inputs of the models. The Baijiabao landslide, located in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), was taken as a case study to test the prediction ability of the model. The results demonstrated that the GRU algorithm provided the most encouraging results. Such a satisfactory prediction accuracy of the GRU algorithm depends on its ability to fully use the historical information while having fewer hyperparameters to train. It is concluded that the proposed model can be a valuable tool for predicting the displacements of landslides in the TGRA and other dam reservoirs.",We wish to thank the Seventh Geological Brigade of Hubei Geological Bureau for their landslide investigation.,,Sensors,,"Algorithms; Forecasting; Landslides; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer",2022-02-09,2022,2022-02-09,,22,4,1320,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yang, Beibei; Xiao, Ting; Wang, Luqi; Huang, Wei","Yang, Beibei (School of Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, China;, yangbeibei@ytu.edu.cn); Xiao, Ting (School of Geosciences and Info-Physics, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China); Wang, Luqi (School of Civil Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China;, wlq93@cqu.edu.cn); Huang, Wei (The Seventh Geological Brigade of Hubei Geological Bureau, Yichang 443000, China;, huangwei@cug.edu.cn)","Xiao, Ting (Central South University)","Yang, Beibei (Yantai University); Xiao, Ting (Central South University); Wang, Luqi (Chongqing University); Huang, Wei ()",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/4/1320/pdf?version=1644997295,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145420962,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

As one of the influential indicative parameters, electrical conductivity (EC) has a crucial role in calculating the proportion of mineralization. In this study, the integration of an adaptive hybrid of differential evolution and particle swarm optimization (A-DEPSO) with adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is adopted for EC prediction. The A-DEPSO method uses unique mutation and crossover processes to correspondingly boost global and local search mechanisms. It also uses a refreshing operator to prevent the solution from being caught inside the local optimal solutions. This study uses A-DEPSO optimizer for ANFIS training phase to eliminate defects and predict accurately the EC water quality parameter every month at the Maroon River in the southwest of Iran. Accordingly, the recorded dataset originated from the Tange-Takab station from 1980 to 2016 was operated to develop the ANFIS-A-DEPSO model. Besides, the wavelet analysis was jointed to the proposed algorithm in which the original time series of EC was disintegrated into the sub-time series through two mother wavelets to boost the prediction certainty. In the following, the comparison between statistical metrics of the standalone ANFIS, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), wavelet-LSSVM (WLSSVM), wavelet-MARS (W-MARS), wavelet-ANFIS (W-ANFIS) and wavelet-GRNN (W-GRNN) models was implemented. As a result, it was apparent that not only was the W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO model able to rise remarkably the EC prediction certainty, but W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO (R = 0.988, RMSE = 53.841, and PI = 0.485) also had the edge over other models with Dmey mother in terms of EC prediction. Moreover, the W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO can improve the RMSE compared to the standalone ANFIS-DEPSO model, accounting for 80%. Hence, this model can create a closer approximation of EC value through W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO model, which is likely to act as a promising procedure to simulate the prediction of EC data.",,,Scientific Reports,,"Algorithms; Electric Conductivity; Fuzzy Logic; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Quality",2022-03-23,2022,2022-03-23,,12,1,4934,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmadianfar, Iman; Shirvani-Hosseini, Seyedehelham; He, Jianxun; Samadi-Koucheksaraee, Arvin; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher","Ahmadianfar, Iman (Department of Civil Engineering, Behbahan Khatam Alanbia University of Technology, Behbahan, Iran); Shirvani-Hosseini, Seyedehelham (Department of Chemical Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran); He, Jianxun (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada); Samadi-Koucheksaraee, Arvin (Department of Civil Engineering, Behbahan Khatam Alanbia University of Technology, Behbahan, Iran); Yaseen, Zaher Mundher (Adjunct Research Fellow, USQ’s Advanced Data Analytics Research Group, School of Mathematics Physics and Computing, University of Southern Queensland, QLD 4350, Toowoomba, Australia; New Era and Development in Civil Engineering Research Group, Scientific Research Center, Al-Ayen University, 64001, Thi-Qar, Iraq)","Ahmadianfar, Iman (Behbahan Khatam Alanbia University of Technology)","Ahmadianfar, Iman (Behbahan Khatam Alanbia University of Technology); Shirvani-Hosseini, Seyedehelham (Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch); He, Jianxun (University of Calgary); Samadi-Koucheksaraee, Arvin (Behbahan Khatam Alanbia University of Technology); Yaseen, Zaher Mundher (University of Southern Queensland; Al-Ayen University)",10,10,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08875-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146500399,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

While the presence of the COVID-19 in untreated drinking water is possible, it is yet to be detected in the drinking-water supplies. COVID-19 viral fragments have been found in excrete, this call for wastewater monitoring and analysis (wastewater surveillance) of the potential health risk. This raises concern about the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the water systems. The economic limits on the medical screening for the SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 worldwide are turning to wastewater-based epidemiology as great potential tools for assessing and management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveillance and tracking of the pathogens in the wastewater are key to the early warning system and public health strategy monitoring of the COVID-19. Currently, RT-qPCR assays is been developed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA specimen clinical testing and detection in the water system. Convectional wastewater treatment methods and disinfection are expected to eradicate the SAR-CoV-2. Chlorine, UV radiation, ozone, chloramine is been used to inactivate and disinfect the water treatment system against the SARS-CoV-2. Water management and design of the water infrastructure require major changes to accommodate climate change, water cycle, reimaging of digitalization, infrastructure and privacy protection. The water digital revolution, biosensors and nanoscale, contact tracing, knowledge management can accelerate with disruption of the COVID-19 outbreak (water-health-digital nexus).","The authors wish to acknowledge the University of Johannesburg (UJ), Water Research Commission (WRC), Afrika Kommt!

From the national level, financial risk investment activities directly affect the development process of the information technology industry and social and economic benefits. The management of financial risk investment has received more attention, and the types and difficulties of risks are also gradually increasing. Financial regulatory agencies urgently need to establish a sensitive and scientific economic hazard early alarm system. The perfect earlier alarm system stands based on in-depth scientific theoretical research, so studying financial security evaluation and systemic economic earlier alarm systems is of great practical significance. Taking the systemic financial risk as the research object, this paper analyzes the mechanism of financial systemic risk. After that, deep learning technology in financial investment has been used for the first time to reconstruct the index system of financial security evaluation and early warning. The application of deep learning technology in the early warning of systemic financial risks is realized, which provides a reliable basis for the regulatory authorities to build a financial risk early warning system and makes empirical research.",,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Deep Learning; Investments; Financial Management; Industry; Technology,2022-10-11,2022,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,2022,,3062566,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sun, Yang; Li, Jiajun","Sun, Yang (School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an 710072, Shaanxi, China, nwpu.edu.cn); Li, Jiajun (School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an 710072, Shaanxi, China, nwpu.edu.cn)","Sun, Yang (Northwestern Polytechnical University)","Sun, Yang (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Li, Jiajun (Northwestern Polytechnical University)",0,0,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/3062566.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151795816,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",

As an emerging technology, intelligent logging lithology identification has received great attention recently, which aims to infer the lithology type through the well-logging curves using machine-learning methods. However, the model trained on the interpreted logging data is not effective in predicting new exploration well due to the data distribution discrepancy. In this article, we aim to train a lithology identification model for the target well using a large amount of source-labeled logging data and a small amount of target-labeled data. The challenges of this task lie in three aspects: 1) the distribution misalignment; 2) the data divergence; and 3) the cost limitation. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel active adaptation for logging lithology identification (AALLI) framework that combines active learning (AL) and domain adaptation (DA). The contributions of this article are three-fold: 1) the domain-discrepancy problem in intelligent logging lithology identification is first investigated in this article, and a novel framework that incorporates AL and DA into lithology identification is proposed to handle the problem; 2) we design a discrepancy-based AL and pseudolabeling (PL) module and an instance importance weighting module to query the most uncertain target information and retain the most confident source information, which solves the challenges of cost limitation and distribution misalignment; and 3) we develop a reliability detecting module to improve the reliability of target pseudolabels, which, together with the discrepancy-based AL and PL module, solves the challenge of data divergence. Extensive experiments on three real-world well-logging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the baselines.",,This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Project of China under Grant 2018AAA0100800 and Grant 2018YFE0106800; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61903353 and Grant 61725304; in part by the SINOPEC Programmes for Science and Technology Development under Grant PE19008-8; in part by the Major Science and Technology Project of Anhui Province under Grant 912198698036; in part by the Youth Development Fund of Institute of Artificial Intelligence under Grant IAI2020QP001; and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant WK2100000013.,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,,Machine Learning; Reproducibility of Results,2022-07-19,2022,2022-07-19,2022-08,52,8,8073-8087,Closed,Article,"Chang, Ji; Kang, Yu; Zheng, Wei Xing; Cao, Yang; Li, Zerui; Lv, Wenjun; Wang, Xing-Mou","Chang, Ji (Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China); Kang, Yu (State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China; Institute of Advanced Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China); Zheng, Wei Xing (School of Computer, Data and Mathematical Sciences, Western Sydney University, Sydney, NSW, 2751, Australia); Cao, Yang (Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China); Li, Zerui (Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center, Hefei, 230088, China); Lv, Wenjun (Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China); Wang, Xing-Mou (Shengli Geophysical Research Institute, SINOPEC, Dongying, 257022, China)","Kang, Yu (University of Science and Technology of China; University of Science and Technology of China)","Chang, Ji (University of Science and Technology of China); Kang, Yu (University of Science and Technology of China; University of Science and Technology of China); Zheng, Wei Xing (Western Sydney University); Cao, Yang (University of Science and Technology of China); Li, Zerui (); Lv, Wenjun (University of Science and Technology of China); Wang, Xing-Mou (Sinopec (China))",18,18,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135462110,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

A total of 118 landslide locations were recorded and divided in the training and testing datasets. We selected 25 conditioning factors, and of these, we specified the most important ones by an information gain ratio (IGR) technique. We assessed the performance of the DP model using statistical measures including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure, and area under-the-receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Three benchmark algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), REPTree, and NBTree, were used to check the applicability of the proposed model. The results by IGR concluded that of the 25 conditioning factors, only 16 factors were important for our modeling procedure, and of these, distance to road, road density, lithology and land use were the four most significant factors. Results based on the testing dataset revealed that the DP model had the highest accuracy (0.926) of the compared algorithms, followed by NBTree (0.917), REPTree (0.903), and SVM (0.894). The landslide susceptibility maps prepared from the DP model with AUC = 0.870 performed the best. We consider the DP model a suitable tool for landslide susceptibility mapping.","The authors would like to thank the Vice Chancellorship of Research and Technology, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran for supplying required data, reports, useful maps, and their nationwide geodatabase to the first author (Bahareh Ghasemian) as a postdoctoral fellowship scheme.

Multiple models have been developed to demonstrate the practical applications of the quantum properties. In this study, we first demonstrate that the previously proposed quanvolutional neural network (QuanvNN) using a randomly generated quantum circuit improves the image classification accuracy of a fully connected neural network against the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research 10 class (CIFAR-10) dataset from 92.0% to 93.0% and from 30.5% to 34.9%, respectively. We then propose a new model referred to as a Neural Network with Quantum Entanglement (NNQE) using a strongly entangled quantum circuit combined with Hadamard gates. The new model further improves the image classification accuracy of MNIST and CIFAR-10 to 93.8% and 36.0%, respectively. Unlike other QML methods, the proposed method does not require optimization of the parameters inside the quantum circuits; hence, it requires only limited use of the quantum circuit. Given the small number of qubits and relatively shallow depth of the proposed quantum circuit, the proposed method is well suited for implementation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. While promising results were obtained by the proposed method when applied to the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a test against a more complicated German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset degraded the image classification accuracy from 82.2% to 73.4%. The exact causes of the performance improvement and degradation are currently an open question, prompting further research on the understanding and design of suitable quantum circuits for image classification neural networks for colored and complex data.",,This research was funded by Australian Government Research Training Program and Commonwealth Scientific Industrial and Research Organisation.,Sensors,,,2023-03-02,2023,2023-03-02,,23,5,2753,All OA; Gold,Article,"Riaz, Farina; Abdulla, Shahab; Suzuki, Hajime; Ganguly, Srinjoy; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Hopkins, Susan","Riaz, Farina (Commonweatlh Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; UniSQ Collage, University of Southern Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia); Abdulla, Shahab (UniSQ Collage, University of Southern Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia); Suzuki, Hajime (Commonweatlh Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia); Ganguly, Srinjoy (UniSQ Collage, University of Southern Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia); Deo, Ravinesh C.

This paper aims to forecast dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration using a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) hybrid model coupled with maximum overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) as a feature decomposition approach for Surma River water using a set of water quality hydro-meteorological variables. The proposed hybrid model is compared with numerous machine learning methods, namely Bayesian ridge regression (BNR), k-nearest neighbourhood (KNN), kernel ridge regression (KRR), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR). The investigational results show that the proposed model of MODWT-MARS has a better prediction than the comparing benchmark models and individual standalone counter parts. The result shows that the hybrid algorithms (i.e. MODWT-MARS) outperformed the other models (r = 0.981, WI = 0.990, RMAE = 2.47%, and MAE = 0.089).

Controlling the mud weight within the SMW limits would help avoid many serious problems such as wellbore instability issues, loss of circulation, etc. SMW can be defined by the minimum mud weight below which shear failure (breakout) may occur (MWBO) and the maximum mud weight above which tensile failure (breakdown) may occur (MWBD). These limits can be determined from the geomechanical analysis of downhole formations. However, such analysis is not always accessible for most drilled wells. Therefore, in this study, a new approach is introduced to develop a new data-driven model to estimate the safe mud weight range in no time and without additional cost. New models were developed using an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate both MWBO and MWBD directly from the logging data that are usually available for most wells. The ANN-based models were trained using actual data from a Middle Eastern field before being tested by an unseen dataset. The models achieved high accuracy exceeding 92% upon comparing the predicted and observed output values. Additionally, new equations were established based on the optimized ANN models’ weights and biases whereby both MWBO and MWBD can be calculated without the need for any complicated codes. Finally, another dataset from the same field was then used to validate the new equations and the results demonstrated the high robustness of the new equations to estimate MWBO and MWBD with a low mean absolute percentage error of 0.60% at maximum. So, unlike the costly conventional approaches, the newly developed equations would facilitate determining the SMW limits in a timely and economically effective way, with high accuracy whenever the logging data are available.",,,Scientific Reports,,,2022-09-21,2022,2022-09-21,,12,1,15773,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gowida, Ahmed; Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid; Elkatatny, Salaheldin","Gowida, Ahmed (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Gowida, Ahmed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",5,5,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20195-7.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151185494,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Oil family grouping helps us track migration pathways, identify the number of active source rock(s), and examine the reservoir continuity. To date, almost in all oil family typing studies, common statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) have been used. However, there is no publication regarding using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for examining the oil families in petroleum basins. Hence, oil family typing requires novel and not overused and common techniques. This paper is the first report of oil family typing using ANNs as robust computational methods. To this end, a self-organization map (SOM) neural network associated with three clustering validity indexes was employed on oil samples belonging to the Iranian part of the Persian Gulf oilfields. For the SOM network, at first, 10 default clusters were selected. Afterward, three effective clustering validity coefficients, namely, Calinski-Harabasz (CH), Silhouette (SH), and Davies-Bouldin (DB), were studied to find the optimum number of clusters. Accordingly, among 10 default clusters, the maximum CH (62) and SH (0.58) were acquired for 4 clusters. Similarly, the lowest DB (0.8) was obtained for four clusters. Thus, all three validation coefficients introduced four clusters as the optimum number of clusters or oil families. According to the geochemical parameters, it can be deduced that the corresponding source rocks of four oil families have been deposited in a marine carbonate depositional environment under dysoxic-anoxic conditions. However, oil families show some differences based on geochemical data. The number of oil families identified in the present report is consistent with those previously reported by other researchers in the same study area. However, the techniques used in the present paper, which have not been implemented so far, can be introduced as more straightforward for clustering purposes in oil family typing than those of common and overused methods of PCA and HCA.",,,ACS Omega,,,2022-04-02,2022,2022-04-02,2022-04-12,7,14,11578-11586,All OA; Gold,Article,"Safaei-Farouji, Majid; Band, Shahab S.; Mosavi, Amir","Safaei-Farouji, Majid (School of Geology, College of Science, University of Tehran, 1417935840, Tehran, Iran); Band, Shahab S.

Yet, due to the fundamentally weak non-linearities of traditional electromagnetic materials, such analog processors have been so far largely confined to simple linear projections such as image edge detection or matrix multiplications. Complex neuromorphic computing tasks, which inherently require strong non-linearities, have so far remained out-of-reach of wave-based solutions, with a few attempts that implemented non-linearities on the digital front, or used weak and inflexible non-linear sensors, restraining the learning performance. Here, we tackle this issue by demonstrating the relevance of time-Floquet physics to induce a strong non-linear entanglement between signal inputs at different frequencies, enabling a power-efficient and versatile wave platform for analog extreme deep learning involving a single, uniformly modulated dielectric layer and a scattering medium. We prove the efficiency of the method for extreme learning machines and reservoir computing to solve a range of challenging learning tasks, from forecasting chaotic time series to the simultaneous classification of distinct datasets.

Some have invested in fluorescence-based online monitoring probes to measure phycocyanin, a pigment found in cyanobacteria, but it is not clear how to best use the data generated. Previous studies have focused on correlating phycocyanin fluorescence and cyanobacteria cell counts. However, not all utilities collect cell count data, making this method impossible to apply in some cases. Instead, this paper proposes a novel approach to determine when a utility needs to respond to a HAB based on machine learning by identifying anomalies in phycocyanin fluorescence data without the need for corresponding cell counts or biovolume. Four widespread and open source algorithms are evaluated on data collected at four buoys in Lake Erie from 2014 to 2019: local outlier factor (LOF), One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), elliptic envelope, and Isolation Forest (iForest). When trained on standardized historical data from 2014 to 2018 and tested on labelled 2019 data collected at each buoy, the One-Class SVM and elliptic envelope models both achieve a maximum average F1 score of 0.86 among the four datasets. Therefore, One-Class SVM and elliptic envelope are promising algorithms for detecting potential HABs using fluorescence data only.","The authors acknowledge funding from the City of Toronto, the City of Hamilton, the Regional Municipality of Niagara, the Regional Municipality of York, the Regional Municipality of Durham, and the Union Water Supply System.

Although recent SNNs trained with supervised backpropagation show classification accuracy comparable to deep networks, the performance of unsupervised learning-based SNNs remains much lower. This paper presents a heterogeneous recurrent spiking neural network (HRSNN) with unsupervised learning for spatio-temporal classification of video activity recognition tasks on RGB (KTH, UCF11, UCF101) and event-based datasets (DVS128 Gesture). We observed an accuracy of 94.32% for the KTH dataset, 79.58% and 77.53% for the UCF11 and UCF101 datasets, respectively, and an accuracy of 96.54% on the event-based DVS Gesture dataset using the novel unsupervised HRSNN model. The key novelty of the HRSNN is that the recurrent layer in HRSNN consists of heterogeneous neurons with varying firing/relaxation dynamics, and they are trained via heterogeneous spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) with varying learning dynamics for each synapse. We show that this novel combination of heterogeneity in architecture and learning method outperforms current homogeneous spiking neural networks. We further show that HRSNN can achieve similar performance to state-of-the-art backpropagation trained supervised SNN, but with less computation (fewer neurons and sparse connection) and less training data.",,This study was based on work sponsored by the Army Research Office and was accomplished under Grant Number W911NF-19-1-0447.,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,,2023-01-30,2023,2023-01-30,,17,,994517,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chakraborty, Biswadeep; Mukhopadhyay, Saibal","Chakraborty, Biswadeep (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States); Mukhopadhyay, Saibal (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States)","Chakraborty, Biswadeep (Georgia Institute of Technology)","Chakraborty, Biswadeep (Georgia Institute of Technology); Mukhopadhyay, Saibal (Georgia Institute of Technology)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.994517/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154943310,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,

While the transformation is pivotal for the sparse spike-based representation of odor data, classification techniques based on the bio-computations of the higher brain areas, which process the spiking data for identification of odor, remain largely unexplored. This paper argues that brain-inspired spiking neural networks constitute a promising approach for the next generation of machine intelligence for odor data processing. Inspired by principles of brain information processing, here we propose the first spiking neural network method and associated deep machine learning system for classification of odor data. The paper demonstrates that the proposed approach has several advantages when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Based on results obtained using a benchmark dataset, the model achieved a high classification accuracy for a large number of odors and has the capacity for incremental learning on new data.

Henceforth, the continuous monitoring of water quality is mandatory to control the pollution level in surface water bodies. In this work, remote sensing technology integrated with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm, a new technique called Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Novel Technique (STHNT), was used to predict, and monitor the chemical water quality pollution level through the Water Quality Index (WQI). The Two Bands Regression Empirical (TBRE) water quality model has been used to retrieve water quality parameters from multi-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 MSI). The Nonlinear Auto-regressive Neural Network (NARNET), which is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), was set up to predict the water quality index. Based on the model performed on the remote sensing water quality data, it is inferred that NARNET (Coefficient of determination-R2:0.9911, Root Mean Square Error-RMSE:1.693 and Sum of Squares of Error-SSE:14.33) provides significant results in predicting WQI. Therefore, the combined remote sensing technology with artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in water resource management, which helps in reducing the pollution level in surface water bodies.Graphical Abstract","This research is supported by Big Data Analytics/ Hyperspectral Remote Sensing, ICPS Division, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India (Reference Number: BDID/01/23/2014-HSRS/14).

Periodic inspection of the HEs is particularly important to keep high efficiency of the entire system. In this paper, a novel ultrasonic water immersion inspection method is presented based on circumferential wave (CW) propagation to detect defective HE. Thin patch-type piezoelectric elements with multiple resonance frequencies were adopted for the ultrasonic inspection of narrow-spaced HE in an immersion test. Water-filled HE was used to simulate defective HE because water is the most reliable indicator of the defect. The HE will leak water no matter what the defect pattern is. Furthermore, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to investigate the received CW, and inverse CWT was applied to separate frequency bands corresponding to the thickness and lateral resonance modes of the piezoelectric element. Different arrangements of intact and leaky HE were tested with several pairs of thin piezoelectric patch probes in various instrumental setups. Also, direct waveforms in the water without HE were used as reference signals, to indicate instrumental gain and probe sensitivity. Moreover, all filtered CW corresponding to resonance modes together with the direct waveforms in the water were used to train the deep neural networks (DNNs). As a result, an automatic HE state classification method was obtained, and the accuracy of the applied DNN was estimated as 99.99%.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Korea government (MSIT) (grant number NRF-2020M2D2A1A02069933).",Science Progress,,,2023-01,2023,2023-02-01,2023-01,106,1,00368504221146081,Closed,Article,"Malikov, Azamatjon Kakhramon ugli; Cho, Younho; Kim, Young H.; Kim, Jeongnam; Kim, Hyung-Kyu","Malikov, Azamatjon Kakhramon ugli (Graduate School of Mechanical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea); Cho, Younho (School of Mechanical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea); Kim, Young H.

A General Overview,"Hepatic biopsy is the gold standard for staging nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Unfortunately, accessing the liver is invasive, requires a multidisciplinary team and is too expensive to be conducted on large segments of the population. NAFLD starts quietly and can progress until liver damage is irreversible. Given this complex situation, the search for noninvasive alternatives is clinically important. A hallmark of NAFLD progression is the dysregulation in lipid metabolism. In this context, recent advances in the area of machine learning have increased the interest in evaluating whether multi-omics data analysis performed on peripheral blood can enhance human interpretation. In the present review, we show how the use of machine learning can identify sets of lipids as predictive biomarkers of NAFLD progression. This approach could potentially help clinicians to improve the diagnosis accuracy and predict the future risk of the disease. While NAFLD has no effective treatment yet, the key to slowing the progression of the disease may lie in predictive robust biomarkers. Hence, to detect this disease as soon as possible, the use of computational science can help us to make a more accurate and reliable diagnosis. We aimed to provide a general overview for all readers interested in implementing these methods.","In this section, you can acknowledge any support given which is not covered by the author contribution or funding sections.

Therefore, this study utilizes different machine learning scenarios to simulate the solubility of twelve non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2). The considered NSAIDs are Fenoprofen, Flurbiprofen, Ibuprofen, Ketoprofen, Loxoprofen, Nabumetone, Naproxen, Nimesulide, Phenylbutazone, Piroxicam, Salicylamide, and Tolmetin. Physical characteristics of the drugs (molecular weight and melting temperature), operating conditions (pressure and temperature), and solvent property (SCCO2 density) are effectively used to estimate the drug solubility. Monitoring and comparing the prediction accuracy of twelve intelligent paradigms from three categories (artificial neural networks, support vector regression, and hybrid neuro-fuzzy) approves that adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference is the best tool for the considered task. The hybrid optimization strategy adjusts the cluster radius of the subtractive clustering membership function to 0.6111. This model estimates 254 laboratory-measured solubility data with the AAPRE = 3.13%, MSE = 2.58 × 10–9, and R2 = 0.99919. The leverage technique confirms that outliers may poison less than four percent of the experimental data. In addition, the proposed hybrid paradigm is more reliable than the equations of state and available correlations in the literature. Experimental measurements, model predictions, and relevancy analyses justified that the drug solubility in SCCO2 increases by increasing temperature and pressure. The results show that Ibuprofen and Naproxen are the most soluble and insoluble drugs in SCCO2, respectively.",,,Scientific Reports,,,2022-01-20,2022,2022-01-20,,12,1,1043,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rezaei, Tahereh; Nazarpour, Vesal; Shahini, Nahal; Bahmani, Soufia; Shahkar, Amir; Abdihaji, Mohammadreza; Ahmadi, Sina; Shahdost, Farzad Tat","Rezaei, Tahereh (Neuroscience Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran); Nazarpour, Vesal (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran); Shahini, Nahal (Department of Computer Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, 15875-4413, Tehran, Iran); Bahmani, Soufia (Department of Computer Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, 15875-4413, Tehran, Iran); Shahkar, Amir (Department of Transportation Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, 61080, Trabzon, Turkey); Abdihaji, Mohammadreza (Department of Biology, The Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA); Ahmadi, Sina (Department of Computer Engineering, West Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran); Shahdost, Farzad Tat (Department of Electrical Engineering, Garmsar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Semnan, Iran)","Rezaei, Tahereh (Shiraz University of Medical Sciences)","Rezaei, Tahereh (Shiraz University of Medical Sciences); Nazarpour, Vesal (Islamic Azad University, Mashhad); Shahini, Nahal (Amirkabir University of Technology); Bahmani, Soufia (Amirkabir University of Technology); Shahkar, Amir (Karadeniz Technical University); Abdihaji, Mohammadreza (Indiana University Bloomington); Ahmadi, Sina (Islamic Azad University, Tehran); Shahdost, Farzad Tat (Islamic Azad University Semnan)",6,6,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-04942-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144816254,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

Fault diagnosis technology based on dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most commonly used methods. However, due to the lack of fault information, traditional DGA fault diagnosis techniques are difficult to meet increasing power demand in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis model for oil-immersed transformers based on International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ratio methods and probabilistic neural network (PNN) optimized with the modified moth flame optimization algorithm (MMFO). PNN as a radial neural network has good utility and is often used in classification models, but its classification performance is easily affected by the smoothing factor (σ) of the hidden layer and is not stable. This paper addresses this issue using the MMFO to optimize the smoothing factor, which effectively improves the classification accuracy and robustness of PNN. The proposed method was validated by conducting the experiments with the real data collected from transformers. Experimental results show that the MMFO-PNN model improves the fault diagnosis accuracy rate from 70.65 to 99.04%, which is higher than other power transformer fault diagnosis models.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51765042, 61963026).",,ACS Omega,,,2021-07-08,2021,2021-07-08,2021-07-20,6,28,18084-18098,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhou, Yichen; Tao, Lingyu; Yang, Xiaohui; Yang, Li","Zhou, Yichen (College of Qianhu, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330031, China); Tao, Lingyu (College of Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330031, China); Yang, Xiaohui (College of Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330031, China); Yang, Li (College of Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330031, China)","Yang, Xiaohui (Nanchang University)","Zhou, Yichen (Nanchang University); Tao, Lingyu (Nanchang University); Yang, Xiaohui (Nanchang University); Yang, Li (Nanchang University)",5,5,0.47,3.31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8296607,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139578185,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics",

It is very important to understand and apply effective strategies to counter the impact of AMR and its mutation from a medical treatment point of view. The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning/machine learning, has led to a new direction in antimicrobial identification. Furthermore, presently, the availability of huge amounts of data from multiple sources has made it more effective to use these artificial intelligence techniques to identify interesting insights into AMR genes such as new genes, mutations, drug identification, conditions favorable to spread, and so on. Therefore, this paper presents a review of state-of-the-art challenges and opportunities. These include interesting input features posing challenges in use, state-of-the-art deep-learning/machine-learning models for robustness and high accuracy, challenges, and prospects to apply these techniques for practical purposes. The paper concludes with the encouragement to apply AI to the AMR sector with the intention of practical diagnosis and treatment, since presently most studies are at early stages with minimal application in the practice of diagnosis and treatment of disease.","The authors thank Sejong University, Seoul and Hanyang University, Seoul for providing the logistic support.",This research received no external funding.,Antibiotics,,,2023-03-06,2023,2023-03-06,,12,3,523,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ali, Tabish; Ahmed, Sarfaraz; Aslam, Muhammad","Ali, Tabish (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea); Ahmed, Sarfaraz (Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea); Aslam, Muhammad (Department of Artificial Intelligence, Sejong University, Seoul 05006, Republic of Korea)","Aslam, Muhammad (Sejong University)","Ali, Tabish (Hanyang University); Ahmed, Sarfaraz (Hanyang University); Aslam, Muhammad (Sejong University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/12/3/523/pdf?version=1678098871,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155994912,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

As pathogens evolve tactics for evading antibiotics, therapies decline in efficacy and must be replaced, distinguishing antibiotics from most other forms of drug development. Together with a slow and expensive antibiotic development pipeline, the proliferation of drug-resistant pathogens drives urgent interest in computational methods that promise to expedite candidate discovery. Strides in artificial intelligence (AI) have encouraged its application to multiple dimensions of computer-aided drug design, with increasing application to antibiotic discovery. This review describes AI-facilitated advances in the discovery of both small molecule antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. Beyond the essential prediction of antimicrobial activity, emphasis is also given to antimicrobial compound representation, determination of drug-likeness traits, antimicrobial resistance, and de novo molecular design. Given the urgency of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, we analyze uptake of open science best practices in AI-driven antibiotic discovery and argue for openness and reproducibility as a means of accelerating preclinical research. Finally, trends in the literature and areas for future inquiry are discussed, as artificially intelligent enhancements to drug discovery at large offer many opportunities for future applications in antibiotic development.","Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez holds a Presidential Professorship at the University of Pennsylvania, is a recipient of the Langer Prize by the AIChE Foundation and acknowledges funding from the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism, the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania, the Nemirovsky Prize, the Dean’s Innovation Fund from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award number R35GM138201, and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA; HDTRA11810041 and HDTRA1-21-1-0014).

Multiphase flow meters (MPFMs) and test separators have been used to estimate well production rates. Due to economic and technical issues with MPFMs, especially for high gas-oil ratio (GOR) reservoirs, the use of a choke formula for estimating well production rate is still popular. The objective of this study is to implement different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the oil rate through wellhead chokes. Support-vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF) were used to generate different models to predict the production rates for high GOR and WC wells. A set of data (548 wells) was obtained from oil fields in the Middle East. GOR varied from 1000 to 9351 scf/stb, and WC ranged from 1 to 60%. Around 300 wells were flowing under critical flow conditions, while the rest were subcritical. Hence, two cases were studied using each AI model. Seventy percent of the data was used to train both RF and SVM models, while 30% of the data was used to test and validate these models. The developed RF and SVM models were then compared against the previous empirical formulas. The RF model in both critical and subcritical flow conditions was able to perfectly match the actual oil rates. SVM was able to predict the general trend for the oil rates but missed some of the sharp changes in the oil rate trend. The average absolute percent error (AAPE) values in the subcritical flow for SVM and RF were 1.7 and 0.7%, respectively, while in the critical flow, the AAPE values were 1.4 and 0.75% for SVM and RF models, respectively. SVM and RF models outperform the published formulas by 34%. The results from this study will help to estimate the real-time oil and gas rates based on the available data from wellhead chokes without the need for field intervention.",The authors acknowledge King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals for permitting the publication of this work.,This research received no external funding.,ACS Omega,,,2021-07-20,2021,2021-07-20,2021-08-03,6,30,19484-19493,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid; Al-Dhaif, Redha; Elkatatny, Salaheldin; Shehri, Dhafer Al","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Al-Dhaif, Redha (College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Shehri, Dhafer Al (College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Ibrahim, Ahmed Farid (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Al-Dhaif, Redha (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Shehri, Dhafer Al (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",2,2,,0.54,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8340095,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139807543,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Psychomotor performance occurs in real-time, hence a continuous assessment is necessary to provide action-oriented feedback and error avoidance guidance. We outline a deep learning application, the Intelligent Continuous Expertise Monitoring System (ICEMS), to assess surgical bimanual performance at 0.2-s intervals. A long-short term memory network was built using neurosurgeon and student performance in 156 virtually simulated tumor resection tasks. Algorithm predictive ability was tested separately on 144 procedures by scoring the performance of neurosurgical trainees who are at different training stages. The ICEMS successfully differentiated between neurosurgeons, senior trainees, junior trainees, and students. Trainee average performance score correlated with the year of training in neurosurgery. Furthermore, coaching and risk assessment for critical metrics were demonstrated. This work presents a comprehensive technical skill monitoring system with predictive validation throughout surgical residency training, with the ability to detect errors.","Authors would like to thank all participants of this study.

Recent research utilizes the advantage of convolutional calculations to extract and learn complicated information from 17 environmental covariates in rice and achieve promising results. However, as the complexity and interconnectivity in soil-crop ecosystem, just relying on convolutional calculations and a deep network structure is far from enough. The data processed by traditional deep learning technologies even with convolutional calculations are limited to Euclidean space; these architectures do not have the ability to extract information from the relationships in graph structures, which may contain rich information. Thus, in this paper, we try to integrate graph information into convolutional calculations for heavy metal prediction and propose a model named ConvGNN-HM. ConvGNN-HM combines the advantages of graph learning and convolutional calculations to predict heavy metal concentrations in a soil-rice system with analysis of 17 environmental factors. For comparison, we conduct an experiment to compare ConvGNN-HM with techniques with convolutional neural networks, multilayer perceptron, back-propagation neural networks, support vector machine, random forest, Bayesian ridge regression, and multiple linear regression. The experimental results illustrate that ConvGNN-HM got the best prediction values; the R2 values of ConvGNN-HM for cadmium (Cd), plumbum (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), and hydrargyrum (Hg) in rice were 0.84, 0.75, 0.79, 0.49, and 0.83, respectively, and the MAE values were also acceptable. We further conduct sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the stability and robustness of ConvGNN-HM. This study demonstrates the usefulness of combining graph learning and convolutional calculations in the prediction of heavy metal concentrations and provides a new perspective to build multidimensional and multi-scale complex ecosystem models.",The authors are extremely thankful to the anonymous reviewers that work in this paper.,Not applicable.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,"Soil; Oryza; Ecosystem; Bayes Theorem; Soil Pollutants; Metals, Heavy; Neural Networks, Computer; China; Environmental Monitoring",2023-01-23,2023,2023-01-23,2023-03,30,15,44100-44111,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Zhuo; Li, Yuanyuan; Bai, Yang; Li, Ya; Liu, Meng","Zhang, Zhuo (College of Information and Communication Technology, Guangzhou College of Commerce, 510000, Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China); Li, Yuanyuan (Hunan Pinbiao Huace Testing Technology Co., Ltd, 410005, Changsha, People’s Republic of China); Bai, Yang (General Hospital of Northern Theater Command, 110000, Shenyang, People’s Republic of China); Li, Ya (Ningbo Artificial Intelligence Institute, Shanghai Jiaotong University, 315000, Ningbo, People’s Republic of China); Liu, Meng (General Hospital of Northern Theater Command, 110000, Shenyang, People’s Republic of China)","Li, Yuanyuan ","Zhang, Zhuo (); Li, Yuanyuan (); Bai, Yang (); Li, Ya (Shanghai Jiao Tong University); Liu, Meng ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154759349,41 Environmental Sciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

In the past few decades, with the country’s rapid development, water pollution has become a significant problem many countries face. Most of the existing water quality evaluation uses a single time-invariant model to simulate the evolution process, which cannot directly describe the complex behavior of long-term water quality evolution. In addition, the traditional comprehensive index method, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and gray pattern recognition have more subjective factors. It can lead to an inevitable subjectivity of the results and weak applicability. Given these shortcomings, this paper proposes a deep learning-improved comprehensive pollution index method to predict future water quality development. As a first processing step, the historical data is normalized. Three deep learning models, multilayer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are used to train historical data. The optimal data prediction model is selected through simulation and comparative analysis of relevant measured data, and the improved entropy weight comprehensive pollution index method is applied to evaluate future water quality changes. Compared with the traditional time-invariant evaluation model, the feature of this model is that it can effectively reflect the development of water quality in the future. Moreover, the entropy weight method is introduced to balance the errors caused by subjective weight. The result shows that LSTM performs well in accurately identifying and predicting water quality. And the deep learning–improved comprehensive pollution index method can provide helpful information and enlightenment for water quality change, which can help improve the water quality prediction and scientific management of coastal water resources.",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,2023-04-26,2023,2023-04-26,2023-04-26,,,1-14,Closed,Article,"Yang, Haitao; Jia, Chao; Yang, Fan; Yang, Xiao; Wei, Ruchun","Yang, Haitao (Institute of Marine Science and Technology, Shandong University, Binhai Road No.72, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Institute of Marine Geology and Engineering, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Jia, Chao (Institute of Marine Science and Technology, Shandong University, Binhai Road No.72, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Institute of Marine Geology and Engineering, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Key Laboratory of Geological Safety of Coastal Urban Underground Space, MNR, 266100, Qingdao, China); Yang, Fan (Institute of Marine Science and Technology, Shandong University, Binhai Road No.72, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Institute of Marine Geology and Engineering, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Yang, Xiao (Institute of Marine Science and Technology, Shandong University, Binhai Road No.72, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Institute of Marine Geology and Engineering, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Wei, Ruchun (Institute of Marine Science and Technology, Shandong University, Binhai Road No.72, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Institute of Marine Geology and Engineering, 266237, Qingdao, Shandong, China)","Jia, Chao (Shandong University; ; )","Yang, Haitao (Shandong University); Jia, Chao (Shandong University); Yang, Fan (Shandong University); Yang, Xiao (Shandong University); Wei, Ruchun (Shandong University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157519536,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

The TOC content gives important indications about the source rocks and hydrocarbon volume. Various techniques have been utilized for TOC quantification, either by geochemical analysis of source rocks in laboratories or using well logs to develop mathematical correlations and advanced machine learning models. Laboratory methods require intense sampling intervals to have an accurate understanding of the reservoir, and depending on the thickness of the interested formation, it can be time-consuming and costly. Empirical correlations based on well logs (e.g., density, sonic, gamma ray, and resistivity) showed fast predictions and very reasonable accuracies. However, other important parameters such as thermal neutron logs have not been studied yet as a potential input for providing reliable TOC predictions. Also, different studies estimate the TOC based on the well-logging data for various formations; however, limited studies were reported to predict the TOC for the Horn River Formation. Therefore, the objective of this study is to estimate the TOC variations based on the thermal neutron logs using one of the largest source rocks in Canada: The Horn River Formation. More than 150 data sets were collected and used in this work. The parameters of the artificial neural network (ANN) model were fine-tuned in order to improve the model's prediction performance. Furthermore, an empirical correlation was developed utilizing the optimized ANN model to allow fast and direct application for the developed model. The developed correlation can predict the TOC with an average absolute error of 0.52 wt %. The proposed TOC model was able to outperform the previous models, and the coefficient of determination was increased from 0.28 to 0.73. Overall, the proposed TOC model can provide high accuracy for TOC ranges from 0.3 to 6.44 wt %. The developed model can provide a real-time quantification for the organic matter maturity, helping to allocate the zones of mature organic matter within the drilled formations.",The College of Petroleum and Geoscience at King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals is acknowledged for the support and permission to publish this work.,,ACS Omega,,,2023-01-24,2023,2023-01-24,2023-02-07,8,5,4790-4801,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hassan, Amjed; Mohammed, Emad; Oshaish, Ali; Badhafere, Dhafer; Ayranci, Korhan; Dong, Tian; bin Waheed, Umair; El-Husseiny, Ammar; Mahmoud, Mohamed","Hassan, Amjed (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Mohammed, Emad (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Oshaish, Ali (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Badhafere, Dhafer (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Ayranci, Korhan (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Dong, Tian (Key Laboratory of Tectonics and Petroleum Resources of Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, China); bin Waheed, Umair (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); El-Husseiny, Ammar (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia); Mahmoud, Mohamed (College of Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia)","Hassan, Amjed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Mahmoud, Mohamed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Hassan, Amjed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Mohammed, Emad (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Oshaish, Ali (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Badhafere, Dhafer (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Ayranci, Korhan (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Dong, Tian (China University of Geosciences); bin Waheed, Umair (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); El-Husseiny, Ammar (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Mahmoud, Mohamed (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",0,0,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c06918,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154793829,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

This has led to a series of pathogens developing antibiotic resistance, which poses severe threats to public health systems while also driving up the costs of hospitalization and treatment. Moreover, without proper action and collaboration between academic and health institutions, a catastrophic trend might develop, with the possibility of returning to a pre-antibiotic era.

The knowledge extraction and management compound extracts the water quality knowledge graph from different knowledge sources by using the deep adversarial joint model. The fusing parameter importance learning compound calculates the contribution of parameters in water quality prediction by taking into account both knowledge and data levels of correlation. Finally, a water quality prediction model combining weighted CNN-LSTM with adversarial learning predicts the values of total nitrogen based on real-time monitoring data.

In particular, machine learning (ML) sensors for the prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 are an important option for IoT application in healthcare and ambient assisted living (AAL). Determining a COVID-19 infected status with various diagnostic tests and imaging results is costly and time-consuming. This study provides a fast, reliable and cost-effective alternative tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on the routine blood values (RBVs) measured at admission. The dataset of the study consists of a total of 5296 patients with the same number of negative and positive COVID-19 test results and 51 routine blood values. In this study, 13 popular classifier machine learning models and the LogNNet neural network model were exanimated. The most successful classifier model in terms of time and accuracy in the detection of the disease was the histogram-based gradient boosting (HGB) (accuracy: 100%, time: 6.39 sec). The HGB classifier identified the 11 most important features (LDL, cholesterol, HDL-C, MCHC, triglyceride, amylase, UA, LDH, CK-MB, ALP and MCH) to detect the disease with 100% accuracy. In addition, the importance of single, double and triple combinations of these features in the diagnosis of the disease was discussed. We propose to use these 11 features and their binary combinations as important biomarkers for ML sensors in the diagnosis of the disease, supporting edge computing on Arduino and cloud IoT service.",We thank the method of Erzincan Mengücek Gazi Training and Research Hospital for their support in reaching the material used in this study.

However, sometimes it is possible to exploit latent information from other related tasks to improve the performance of the main one, resulting in a learning paradigm known as Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In this context, the high computational capacity of deep neural networks (DNN) can be combined with the improved generalization performance of MTL, by designing independent output layers for every task and including a shared representation for them. In this paper we exploit this theoretical framework on a problem related to Wind Power Ramps Events (WPREs) prediction in wind farms. Wind energy is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, with potential global spreading and deep penetration in developed and developing countries. One of the main issues with the majority of renewable energy resources is their intrinsic intermittency, which makes it difficult to increase the penetration of these technologies into the energetic mix. In this case, we focus on the specific problem of WPREs prediction, which deeply affect the wind speed and power prediction, and they are also related to different turbines damages. Specifically, we exploit the fact that WPREs are spatially-related events, in such a way that predicting the occurrence of WPREs in different wind farms can be taken as related tasks, even when the wind farms are far away from each other. We propose a DNN-MTL architecture, receiving inputs from all the wind farms at the same time to predict WPREs simultaneously in each of the farms locations. The architecture includes some shared layers to learn a common representation for the information from all the wind farms, and it also includes some specification layers, which refine the representation to match the specific characteristics of each location. Finally we modified the Adam optimization algorithm for dealing with imbalanced data, adding costs which are updated dynamically depending on the worst classified class. We compare the proposal against a baseline approach based on building three different independent models (one for each wind farm considered), and against a state-of-the-art reservoir computing approach. The DNN-MTL proposal achieves very good performance in WPREs prediction, obtaining a good balance for all the classes included in the problem (negative ramp, no ramp and positive ramp).","This work has been subsidized by the projects with references TIN2017-85887-C2-1-P, TIN2017-85887-C2-2-P and TIN2017-90567-REDT of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and FEDER funds.

The advent of deep learning may allow more reliable measurement of RA areas to improve clinical assessments. The aim of this study was to automate cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) RA area measurements and evaluate the clinical utility by assessing repeatability, correlation with invasive haemodynamics and prognostic value.MethodsA deep learning RA area CMR contouring model was trained in a multicentre cohort of 365 patients with pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular pathology and healthy subjects. Inter-study repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)) and agreement of contours (DICE similarity coefficient (DSC)) were assessed in a prospective cohort (n = 36). Clinical testing and mortality prediction was performed in n = 400 patients that were not used in the training nor prospective cohort, and the correlation of automatic and manual RA measurements with invasive haemodynamics assessed in n = 212/400. Radiologist quality control (QC) was performed in the ASPIRE registry, n = 3795 patients. The primary QC observer evaluated all the segmentations and recorded them as satisfactory, suboptimal or failure. A second QC observer analysed a random subcohort to assess QC agreement (n = 1018).ResultsAll deep learning RA measurements showed higher interstudy repeatability (ICC 0.91 to 0.95) compared to manual RA measurements (1st observer ICC 0.82 to 0.88, 2nd observer ICC 0.88 to 0.91). DSC showed high agreement comparing automatic artificial intelligence and manual CMR readers. Maximal RA area mean and standard deviation (SD) DSC metric for observer 1 vs observer 2, automatic measurements vs observer 1 and automatic measurements vs observer 2 is 92.4 ± 3.5 cm2, 91.2 ± 4.5 cm2 and 93.2 ± 3.2 cm2, respectively. Minimal RA area mean and SD DSC metric for observer 1 vs observer 2, automatic measurements vs observer 1 and automatic measurements vs observer 2 was 89.8 ± 3.9 cm2, 87.0 ± 5.8 cm2 and 91.8 ± 4.8 cm2. Automatic RA area measurements all showed moderate correlation with invasive parameters (r = 0.45 to 0.66), manual (r = 0.36 to 0.57). Maximal RA area could accurately predict elevated mean RA pressure low and high-risk thresholds (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve artificial intelligence = 0.82/0.87 vs manual = 0.78/0.83), and predicted mortality similar to manual measurements, both p < 0.01. In the QC evaluation, artificial intelligence segmentations were suboptimal at 108/3795 and a low failure rate of 16/3795. In a subcohort (n = 1018), agreement by two QC observers was excellent, kappa 0.84.ConclusionAutomatic artificial intelligence CMR derived RA size and function are accurate, have excellent repeatability, moderate associations with invasive haemodynamics and predict mortality.",Not applicable.,"Andrew Swift is supported by a Wellcome Trust fellowship grant 205188/Z/16/Z.

Accounting for both, heterogeneity and uncertainty, makes this a computationally-intensive problem challenging for current reservoir simulators. To tackle this, we use differentiable programming with a full-physics model and machine learning to determine the fluid extraction rates that prevent over-pressurization at critical reservoir locations. We use DPFEHM framework, which has trustworthy physics based on the standard two-point flux finite volume discretization and is also automatically differentiable like machine learning models. Our physics-informed machine learning framework uses convolutional neural networks to learn an appropriate extraction rate based on the permeability field.

This study proposed a dynamic model averaging method with Time-varying weight (TV-DMA). Using this method, an integrated prediction model framework for runoff prediction was constructed. The framework determines the main variables suitable for runoff prediction through correlation analysis, and uses TV-DMA and deep learning algorithm to construct an integrated prediction model for runoff. The results demonstrate that the current monthly runoff, the runoff of the previous month, the current monthly temperature, the temperature of the previous month and the current monthly rainfall were the variables suitable for runoff prediction. The results of runoff prediction show that the TV-DMA model has the highest prediction accuracy (with 0.97 Nash-efficiency coefficient (NSE)) and low uncertainty. The interval band of uncertainty was 33.3%-65.5% lower than single model. And the prediction performance of the single model and TV-DMA model in flood season is obviously lower than that in non-flood season. In addition, this study indicate that the current monthly runoff, rainfall and temperature are the important factor affecting the runoff prediction, which should be paid special attention in the runoff prediction.","We thank the Transport Department of Henan Province for their help and guidance.

Indonesia possesses the largest share (65 %) of tropical peat carbon, equal to 57.4 Gt C. Human perturbations such as extensive logging, deforestation and canalization exacerbate water losses, especially during dry seasons, when low precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates combine with the increased drainage to lower groundwater levels. Drying and increasing temperatures of the surface peat exacerbate ignition and wildfire risks within the peat soils. As such, it is critically important to know how groundwater levels in peatlands are changing over space and time. In this study, a multilinear regression model as well as two machine learning algorithms, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, were used to model groundwater level over the study period (2010-12) within a peat dome impacted by drainage canals and multiple wildfires in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Although all three models performed well, based on overall fit, spatial modeling of groundwater level results revealed that extreme gradient boosting (R2 = 0.998, RMSE = 0.048 m) outperformed random forest (R2 = 0.997, RMSE = 0.054 m) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.970, RMSE = 0.221 m) near drainage canals, which are key fire ignition risk locations in the peatlands. Our study also shows that, on average, elevation and precipitation are the most important parameters influencing groundwater level spatiotemporally.",This study was supported in part by NASA grant 80NSSC20K0408 to the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences.

This study aims to explore the potential of fully utilizing the advantages of combining traditional process-based models (PBMs) and data-driven models (DDMs) with general water quality indicators in terms of improving the accuracy and efficiency of predicting ECs in aquatic ecosystems. Two representative ECs, namely Bisphenol A (BPA) and N, N-diethyltoluamide (DEET), in a tropical reservoir were chosen for this study. A total of 36 DDMs based on different input datasets using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) were examined in three case studies. The models were applied in prognosis validation based on easily accessible data on water quality indicators. Our results revealed that all the models yielded good fits when compared to the observed data. These new insights into the advantages using the combination of traditional PBMs and DDMs with general water quality datasets help to overcome the constraints in terms of model accuracy and efficiency as well as technical and budget limitations due to monitoring surveys and laboratory experiments in the study of fate and transport of ECs in aquatic environments.","This research grant is supported by the National University of Singapore PhD Research Scholarship and the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program (E2S2-CREATE project ES-2: Detection, Assessment Modelling of Emerging Contaminants in the Urban Environment).

The current study, based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model, was designed to predict the Warta river (Poland) streamflow for 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days ahead for a data set from the period of 1993–2013. The ANFIS was additionally combined with the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm and employed as a meta-heuristic ANFIS-ACO model, which is a novelty in streamflow prediction studies. The investigations showed that on a daily scale, precipitation had a very weak and insignificant effect on the river’s flow variation, so it was not considered as a predictor input. The predictor inputs were selected by the autocorrelation function from among the daily streamflow time lags for all stations. The predictions were evaluated with the actual streamflow data, using such criteria as root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and R2. According to the NRMSE values, which ranged between 0.016–0.006, 0.030–0.013, and 0.038–0.020 for the 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day lead times, respectively, all predictions were classified as excellent in terms of accuracy (prediction quality). The best RMSE value was 1.551 m3/s and the highest R2 value was equal to 0.998, forecast for 1-day lead time. The combination of ANFIS with the ACO algorithm enabled to significantly improve streamflow prediction. The use of this coupling can averagely increase the prediction accuracies of ANFIS by 12.1%, 12.91%, and 13.66%, for 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day lead times, respectively.

The next step in the evolution of automation is the development of artificial intelligence (AI), i.e. intelligence which is demonstrated by machines and systems, which cannot only perform tasks but also work synergistically with humans and nature. Intelligent systems that can see, analyse situations and respond sensitively to real-time cues, from human gestures and facial expressions to pedestrians crossing a busy street, will reshape transportation, precision agriculture, biodiversity conservation, environmental modelling, public health, construction and manufacturing, as well as initiatives designed to promote prosperity on Earth. This paper explores the connections between AI systems and sustainable development (SD) research.

The article analyzes the results by introducing a comparison with one of the most common and efficient topologies, the long short-term memories, in order to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a reservoir computing approach compared to one currently considered as a standard of recurrent neural network. As benchmark application, two specific processes common in the integrated steelworks are selected, with the purpose of forecasting the future energy exchanges and transformations. The procedures of training, validation and test are based on data analysis, outlier detection and reconciliation and variable selection starting from real field industrial data. The analysis of results shows the effectiveness of deep echo state networks and their strong forecasting capabilities with respect to standard recurrent methodologies both in terms of training procedures and accuracy.","The work described in the present paper was developed within the project entitled “Optimization of the management of the process gases network within the integrated steelworks—GASNET” (Contract No. RFSR-CT-2015-00029) and received funding from the Research Fund for Coal and Steel of the European Union, which is gratefully acknowledged.

Traditional methods of water quality inspection are a cumbersome process and hence, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used as a catalyst for this process. AutoDL is an upcoming field to automate deep learning pipelines and enables model creation and interpretation with minimal code. However, it is still in the nascent stage. This work explores the suitability of adopting AutoDL for Water Quality Assessment by drawing a comparison between AutoDL and a conventional models and analysis to foresee the quality of the water, an appropriate class based on Water Quality Index segregating water bodies into different classes. The accuracy of conventional DL is 1.8% higher than that of AutoDL for binary class water data. The accuracy of conventional DL is 1% higher than that of AutoDL for multiclass water data. The accuracy of conventional model was ~98% to ~99% whereas AutoDL method yielded ~96% to ~98%.

However, their energy requirements now increasingly limit their scalability1. Deep-learning accelerators2–9 aim to perform deep learning energy-efficiently, usually targeting the inference phase and often by exploiting physical substrates beyond conventional electronics. Approaches so far10–22 have been unable to apply the backpropagation algorithm to train unconventional novel hardware in situ. The advantages of backpropagation have made it the de facto training method for large-scale neural networks, so this deficiency constitutes a major impediment. Here we introduce a hybrid in situ–in silico algorithm, called physics-aware training, that applies backpropagation to train controllable physical systems. Just as deep learning realizes computations with deep neural networks made from layers of mathematical functions, our approach allows us to train deep physical neural networks made from layers of controllable physical systems, even when the physical layers lack any mathematical isomorphism to conventional artificial neural network layers. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, we train diverse physical neural networks based on optics, mechanics and electronics to experimentally perform audio and image classification tasks. Physics-aware training combines the scalability of backpropagation with the automatic mitigation of imperfections and noise achievable with in situ algorithms. Physical neural networks have the potential to perform machine learning faster and more energy-efficiently than conventional electronic processors and, more broadly, can endow physical systems with automatically designed physical functionalities, for example, for robotics23–26, materials27–29 and smart sensors30–32.","We thank NTT Research for their financial and technical support.

Increased visceral adiposity and sarcopenia are also risk factors for metabolic disease in people with normal BMI. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can help assess and analyze body composition parameters for predicting cardiometabolic health. The purpose of the study was to systematically explore literature involving AI techniques for body composition assessment and observe general trends.
METHODS: We searched the following databases: Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed. There was a total of 354 search results. After removing duplicates, irrelevant studies, and reviews(a total of 303), 51 studies were included in the systematic review.
RESULTS: AI techniques have been studied for body composition analysis in the context of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer and many specialized diseases. Imaging techniques employed for AI methods include CT (Computerized Tomography), MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), ultrasonography, plethysmography, and EKG(Electrocardiogram). Automatic segmentation of body composition by deep learning with convolutional networks has helped determine and quantify muscle mass. Limitations include heterogeneity of study populations, inherent bias in sampling, and lack of generalizability. Different bias mitigation strategies should be evaluated to address these problems and improve the applicability of AI to body composition analysis.

The integration of AI in surgical subspecialties is under preclinical investigation but is yet to be widely implemented. Plastic surgeons collect standardized data in various settings and could benefit from AI. This systematic review investigates the current clinical applications of AI in plastic and reconstructive surgery.
Methods: A comprehensive literature search of the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PubMed databases was conducted for AI studies with multiple search terms. Articles that progressed beyond the title and abstract screening were then subcategorized based on the plastic surgery subspecialty and AI application.
Results: The systematic search yielded a total of 1820 articles. Forty-four studies met inclusion criteria warranting further analysis. Subcategorization of articles by plastic surgery subspecialties revealed that most studies fell into aesthetic and breast surgery (27%), craniofacial surgery (23%), or microsurgery (14%). Analysis of the research study phase of included articles indicated that the current research is primarily in phase 0 (discovery and invention; 43.2%), phase 1 (technical performance and safety; 27.3%), or phase 2 (efficacy, quality improvement, and algorithm performance in a medical setting; 27.3%). Only one study demonstrated translation to clinical practice.
Conclusions: The potential of AI to optimize clinical efficiency is being investigated in every subfield of plastic surgery, but much of the research to date remains in the preclinical status.

Faults act as important conduits for transporting hydrocarbons and as essential sealing conditions. The location and morphology of faults reflect changes in the shape of the strata, so fault interpretation of seismic data has been an essential task in oil and gas exploration and development. The traditional fault identification method is time-consuming and inaccurate with large uncertainties. This paper proposed a fault recognition method based on 3D-UNet that added attention mechanisms to a convolutional neural network (CNN). This approach takes advantage of the UNet end-to-end architecture and the attention mechanism to focus on essential areas and suppress irrelevant information, allowing the model to focus on more valuable features. A fault identification network for seismic data was proposed by combining the 3D-UNet architecture with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism. The 3D-UNet architecture comprises two parts: encoding and decoding, and the network architecture realizes end-to-end training. At the same time, SE was used to focus on the advantages of feature channels, further improving the accuracy of the network. The model performance was evaluated using the synthetic dataset provided by Wu. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better prediction performance in terms of accuracy, better recognition continuity, and richer fault detail.","This research was funded by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China, grant no. 2021YFC2902003 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant nos. 41704115 and 41774128.",,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,"Neural Networks, Computer",2022-04-21,2022,2022-04-21,2022-04-21,2022,,9856669,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yu, Ting; Wang, Xin; Chen, Tong Jun; Ding, Chang Wei","Yu, Ting (School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xu’zhou 221000, China, cumt.edu.cn); Wang, Xin (School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xu’zhou 221000, China, cumt.edu.cn); Chen, Tong Jun (School of Earth and Geoscience, China University of Mining and Technology, Xu’zhou 221000, China, cumt.edu.cn); Ding, Chang Wei (School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xu’zhou 221000, China, cumt.edu.cn)","Wang, Xin (China University of Mining and Technology)","Yu, Ting (China University of Mining and Technology); Wang, Xin (China University of Mining and Technology); Chen, Tong Jun (China University of Mining and Technology); Ding, Chang Wei (China University of Mining and Technology)",1,1,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/9856669.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147294112,37 Earth Sciences; 3706 Geophysics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

The need to comprehend and predict the dynamics of complex systems have spurred developments in large-scale simulations and a multitude of methods across several disciplines. The goals of understanding and prediction in complex dynamical systems, however, have been hindered by high dimensionality, complexity and chaotic behaviours. Recent advances in data-driven techniques and machine-learning approaches have revolutionized how we model and analyse complex systems. The integration of these techniques with dynamical systems theory opens up opportunities to tackle previously unattainable challenges in modelling and prediction of dynamical systems. While data-driven prediction methods have made great strides in recent years, it is still necessary to develop new techniques to improve their applicability to a wider range of complex systems in science and engineering. This focus issue shares recent developments in the field of complex dynamical systems with emphasis on data-driven, data-assisted and artificial intelligence-based discovery of dynamical systems.

The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in recent decades has resulted in new opportunities and challenges in terms of improving the safety and economics of nuclear reactors. This study briefly introduces modern AI algorithms such as machine learning, deep learning, and evolutionary computing. Furthermore, several studies on the use of AI techniques for nuclear reactor design optimization as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) are reviewed and discussed. The existing obstacles that prevent the further fusion of AI and nuclear reactor technologies so that they can be scaled to real-world problems are classified into two categories: (1) data issues: insufficient experimental data increases the possibility of data distribution drift and data imbalance; (2) black-box dilemma: methods such as deep learning have poor interpretability. Finally, this study proposes two directions for the future fusion of AI and nuclear reactor technologies: (1) better integration of domain knowledge with data-driven approaches to reduce the high demand for data and improve the model performance and robustness; (2) promoting the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technologies to enhance the transparency and reliability of the model.

Digitization of operating rooms and the creation of massive quantities of data have paved the way for machine learning and computer vision applications in surgery. Surgical phase recognition (SPR) is a newly emerging technology that uses data derived from operative videos to train machine and deep learning algorithms to identify the phases of surgery. Advancement of this technology will be key in establishing context-aware surgical systems in the future. By automatically recognizing and evaluating the current surgical scenario, these intelligent systems are able to provide intraoperative decision support, improve operating room efficiency, assess surgical skills, and aid in surgical training and education. Still in its infancy, SPR has been mainly studied in laparoscopic surgeries, with a contrasting stark lack of research within neurosurgery. Given the high-tech and rapidly advancing nature of neurosurgery, we believe SPR has a tremendous untapped potential in this field.

In this domain, learning algorithms must not only be able to handle massive volume of rapidly arriving data, but also adapt themselves to potential emerging changes. The phenomenon of evolving nature of data streams is known as concept drift. While there is a plethora of methods designed for detecting its occurrence, all of them assume that the drift is connected with underlying changes in the source of data. However, one must consider the possibility of a malicious injection of false data that simulates a concept drift. This adversarial setting assumes a poisoning attack that may be conducted in order to damage the underlying classification system by forcing an adaptation to false data. Existing drift detectors are not capable of differentiating between real and adversarial concept drift. In this paper, we propose a framework for robust concept drift detection in the presence of adversarial and poisoning attacks. We introduce the taxonomy for two types of adversarial concept drifts, as well as a robust trainable drift detector. It is based on the augmented restricted Boltzmann machine with improved gradient computation and energy function. We also introduce Relative Loss of Robustness—a novel measure for evaluating the performance of concept drift detectors under poisoning attacks. Extensive computational experiments, conducted on both fully and sparsely labeled data streams, prove the high robustness and efficacy of the proposed drift detection framework in adversarial scenarios.",,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Machine Learning,,,2022-06-02,2022,2022-06-02,2022-06-02,,,1-36,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Korycki, Łukasz; Krawczyk, Bartosz","Korycki, Łukasz (Department of Computer Science, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA); Krawczyk, Bartosz (Department of Computer Science, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA)","Krawczyk, Bartosz (Virginia Commonwealth University)","Korycki, Łukasz (Virginia Commonwealth University); Krawczyk, Bartosz (Virginia Commonwealth University)",3,3,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10994-022-06177-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148373395,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

However, traditional silicon-vision-chips suffer from large time/energy overheads. Further, training conventional deep-learning models is neither scalable nor affordable on edge-devices. Here, a material-algorithm co-design is proposed to emulate human retina and the affordable learning paradigm. Relying on a bottle-brush-shaped semiconducting p-NDI with efficient exciton-dissociations and through-space charge-transport characteristics, a wearable transistor-based dynamic in-sensor Reservoir-Computing system manifesting excellent separability, fading memory, and echo state property on different tasks is developed. Paired with a ‘readout function’ on memristive organic diodes, the RC recognizes handwritten letters and numbers, and classifies diverse costumes with accuracies of 98.04%, 88.18%, and 91.76%, respectively (higher than all reported organic semiconductors). In addition to 2D images, the spatiotemporal dynamics of RC naturally extract features of event-based videos, classifying 3 types of hand gestures at an accuracy of 98.62%. Further, the computing cost is significantly lower than that of the conventional artificial-neural-networks.

We hypothesize that two key components in creating such agents are interactivity and environment grounding, shown to be vital parts of language learning in humans, and posit that interactive narratives should be the environments of choice for such training these agents. These games are simulations in which an agent interacts with the world through natural language-perceiving, acting upon, and talking to the world using textual descriptions, commands, and dialogue-and, as such, exist at the intersection of natural language processing, storytelling, and sequential decision making. We discuss the unique challenges a text games' puzzle-like structure combined with natural language state-and-action spaces provides: knowledge representation, common-sense reasoning, and exploration. Beyond the challenges described so far, progress in the realm of interactive narratives can be applied in adjacent problem domains. These applications provide interesting challenges of their own as well as extensions to those discussed so far. We describe three of them in detail: (1) evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems' common-sense understanding by automatically creating interactive narratives; (2) adapting abstract text-based policies to include other modalities, such as vision; and (3) enabling multi-agent and human-AI collaboration in shared, situated worlds.","We thank Matthew Hausknecht, Xingdi Yuan, and Marc-Alexandre Côté of Microsoft Research for useful discussions on text games and their work on the Jericho and TextWorld platforms.

The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a recent concept that combines the best of both Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, and has already demonstrated its capabilities in different fields. In this paper, we introduce an AIoT architecture where river flood sensors, in each region, can transmit their data via the LoRaWAN to their closest local broadcast center. The latter will relay the collected data via 4G/5G to a centralized cloud server that will analyze the data, predict the status of the rivers countrywide using an efficient Artificial Intelligence approach, and thus, help prevent eventual floods. This approach has proven its efficiency at every level.

Traditional methods for estimating flow rates at test separators fail to identify production trends and require additional costs for maintenance. In response, virtual flow metering (VFM) has emerged as an attractive research area in the oil and gas industry. This study introduces a robust workflow utilizing symbolic regression, extreme gradient boosted trees, and a deep learning model that includes a pipeline of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers and long short-term memory algorithm (LSTM) layers to predict liquid rate and water cut in real time based on pump sensors' data. The novelty of this approach lies in offering a cost-effective and accurate alternative to the usage of multiphase physical flow meters and production testing. Additionally, the study provides insights into the potential of data-driven methods for VFM in electrical submersible pumped wells, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

These neuronal sequences are characterized by robust and reproducible spatiotemporal activation patterns. This suggests that the role of neuronal sequences may be much more fundamental for brain function than is commonly believed. Furthermore, the idea that the brain is not simply a passive observer but an active predictor of its sensory input, is supported by an enormous amount of evidence in fields as diverse as human ethology and physiology, besides neuroscience. Hence, a central aspect of this review is to illustrate how neuronal sequences can be understood as critical for probabilistic predictive information processing, and what dynamical principles can be used as generators of neuronal sequences. Moreover, since different lines of evidence from neuroscience and computational modeling suggest that the brain is organized in a functional hierarchy of time scales, we will also review how models based on sequence-generating principles can be embedded in such a hierarchy, to form a generative model for recognition and prediction of sensory input. We shortly introduce the Bayesian brain hypothesis as a prominent mathematical description of how online, i.e., fast, recognition, and predictions may be computed by the brain. Finally, we briefly discuss some recent advances in machine learning, where spatiotemporally structured methods (akin to neuronal sequences) and hierarchical networks have independently been developed for a wide range of tasks. We conclude that the investigation of specific dynamical and structural principles of sequential brain activity not only helps us understand how the brain processes information and generates predictions, but also informs us about neuroscientific principles potentially useful for designing more efficient artificial neuronal networks for machine learning tasks.",,"Funding.

Mathematical epidemic models can be utilized to forecast the course of an epidemic and cultivate approaches for controlling it. This paper utilizes the real data of spreading COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia for mathematical modeling and complex analyses. This paper introduces the Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, Undetectable, and Deceased (SEIRUD) and Machine learning algorithm to predict and control COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.This COVID-19 has initiated many methods, such as cloud computing, edge-computing, IoT, artificial intelligence. The use of sensor devices has increased enormously. Similarly, several developments in solving the COVID-19 crisis have been used by IoT applications. The new technology relies on IoT variables and the roles of symptoms using wearable sensors to forecast cases of COVID-19. The working model involves wearable devices, occupational therapy, condition control, testing of cases, suspicious and IoT elements. Mathematical modeling is useful for understanding the fundamental principle of the transmission of COVID-19 and providing guidance for possible predictions. The method suggested predicts whether COVID-19 would expand or die in the long term in the population. The mathematical study results and related simulation are described here as a way of forecasting the progress and the possible end of the epidemic with three forms of scenarios: 'No Action,' 'Lockdowns and New Medicine.' The lock case slows it down the peak by minimizing infection and impacts area equality of the infected deformation. This study familiarizes the ideal protocol, which can support the Saudi population to breakdown spreading COVID-19 in an accurate and timely way. The simulation findings have been executed, and the suggested model enhances the accuracy ratio of 89.3%, prediction ratio of 88.7%, the precision ratio of 87.7%, recall ratio of 86.4%, and F1 score of 90.9% compared to other existing methods.",Sameh S.

A transparency measurement algorithm is proposed by combining deep learning, image processing technology, and Secchi disk measurement. The white part of the Secchi disk is cropped by image processing. The classification network based on resnet18 is applied to classify the segmentation results and determine the critical position of the Secchi disk. Then, the semantic segmentation network Deeplabv3+ is used to segment the corresponding water gauge at this position, and subsequently segment the characters on the water gauge.

Then, the advanced SSA are utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of the ESN, including the size of the reservoir, sparse degree, spectral radius and input scale.

The water quality index (WQI) has been developed based on the physicochemical parameters of water samples. In this area, water quality is medium to poor and is found in saline zones; very high pH ranges are directly affected on the water quality in this study area. Conventional WQI computation demands more time and is often observed with enormous errors during the calculation of sub-indices. In the present work, four standalone methods such as additive regression (AR), M5P tree model (M5P), random subspace (RSS), and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to predict WQI based on variable elimination technique. The groundwater samples were collected from the Akot basin area, located in the Akola district, Maharashtra, in India. A total of nine different input combinations were developed in this study. The datasets were demarcated into two classes (ratio 80:20) for model construction (training dataset) and model verification (testing dataset) using a fivefold cross-validation approach. The models were assessed using statistical and graphical appraisal metrics. The best input combinations varied among the model, generally, the optimal input variables (EC, pH, TDS, Ca, Mg, and Cl) during the training and validation stages. Results show that AR outperformed the other data-driven models (R2 = 0.9993, MAE = 0.5243, RMSE = 0.0.6356, %RAE = 3.8449, and RRSE% = 3.9925). The AR is proposed as an ideal model with satisfactory results due to enhanced prediction precision with the minimum number of input parameters and can thus act as the reliable and precise method in the prediction of WQI at the Akot basin.",The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,"Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Humans; India; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,2022-03,29,12,17591-17605,Closed,Article,"Elbeltagi, Ahmed; Pande, Chaitanya B.; Kouadri, Saber; Islam, Abu Reza Md.

These problems can increase downtime and production loss. In these wells, the diagnosis of operation conditions is carried out through downhole dynamometer cards, via pre-established patterns, with human visual effort in the operation centers. Starting with machine learning algorithms, several papers have been published on the subject, but it is still common to have doubts concerning the difficulty level of the dynamometer card classification task and best practices for solving the problem. In the search for answers to these questions, this work carried out sixty tests with more than 50,000 dynamometer cards from 38 wells in the Mossoró, RN, Brazil. In addition, it presented test results for three algorithms (decision tree, random forest and XGBoost), three descriptors (Fourier, wavelet and card load values), as well as pipelines provided by automated machine learning. Tests with and without the tuning of hypermeters, different levels of dataset balancing and various evaluation metrics were evaluated. The research shows that it is possible to detect sensor failures from dynamometer cards.

This work aims to construct different artificial intelligence models for predicting static Poisson's ratio of complex lithology at real time during drilling. The functional networks (FN) and random forest (RF) approaches were utilized using the mechanical drilling parameters as inputs. This study uses a vertical well with 1775 records from complex lithology containing shale, sand, and carbonate for model building. Besides, a different dataset from another well was used to check the models' validity. The results demonstrated that both FN- and RF-based models predicted static Poisson's ratio with significant matching accuracy. The FN technique results' correlation coefficient (R) value of 0.89 and average absolute percentage error (AAPE) values of 10.23% and 10.28% in training and testing processes. While the RF technique is outperformed, as illustrated by the highest R values of 0.99 and 0.94 and the lowest AAPE values of 1.89% and 5.19% for training and testing processes, the robustness and reliability of the developed models were confirmed in the validation process with R values of 0.94 and 0.86 and AAPE values of 11.23% and 5.12% for FN- and RF-based models, respectively.

Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that our model performs comparably to its fully trained deep version on several typical benchmark tasks for DNCs.",,This work was supported in part by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under Grant PA 3460/1-1 and Grant PA 3460/2-1.,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,"Computers; Language; Memory; Neural Networks, Computer",2022-06-01,2022,2022-06-01,2022-06,33,6,2575-2585,All OA; Green,Article,"Paaßen, Benjamin; Schulz, Alexander; Stewart, Terrence C.; Hammer, Barbara","Paaßen, Benjamin (School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2008, Australia; Department of Computer Science, Humboldt University of Berlin, 12489, Berlin, Germany); Schulz, Alexander (Faculty of Technology, Bielefeld University, 33619, Bielefeld, Germany); Stewart, Terrence C.

This study intended to increase the accuracy of machine-learning approaches for land use/land cover classification using Sentinel-2A, and Landsat-8 satellites. This study aimed to implement a proposed method, neural-based with object-based, to produce a model addressed by artificial neural networks (limited parameters) with random forest (hyperparameter) called ANN_RF. This study used multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8) and a normalized digital elevation model as input datasets for the Sana'a city map of 2016. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed model (ANN_RF) is better than the ANN classifier with the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 satellites individually, which may contribute to the development of machine learning through newer researchers and specialists; it also conventionally developed traditional artificial neural networks with seven to ten layers but with access to 1,000's and millions of simulated neurons without resorting to deep learning techniques (ANN_RF).",,,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,,2023-01-06,2023,2023-01-06,,5,,964279,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alshari, Eman A.; Abdulkareem, Mohammed B.; Gawali, Bharti W.","Alshari, Eman A.

Nevertheless, the design of FC requires a large number of experiments to determine the appropriate Compressive Strength (CS). Employment of machine learning algorithms to take advantage of the existing experiments database has been attempted, but model performance can still be improved. In this study, the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was fully analyzed to predict the 28 days CS of FC. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were used to statistically analyze the convergence of the modeled results under the effect of random sampling strategies and the network structures selected. Various statistical measures such as Coefficient of Determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used for validation of model performance. The results show that ANN is a highly efficient predictor of the CS of FC, achieving a maximum R2 value of 0.976 on the training part and an R2 of 0.972 on the testing part, using the optimized C-ANN-[3,4,5,1] structure, which compares with previous published studies. In addition, a sensitivity analysis using Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) over 1000 MCS was also performed to interpret the relationship between the input parameters and 28 days CS of FC. Dry density was found as the variable with the highest impact to predict the CS of FC. The results presented could facilitate and enhance the use of C-ANN in other civil engineering-related problems.",,This research received no external funding.,Materials,,,2020-02-28,2020,2020-02-28,,13,5,1072,All OA; Gold,Article,"Van Dao, Dong; Ly, Hai-Bang; Vu, Huong-Lan Thi; Le, Tien-Thinh; Pham, Binh Thai","Van Dao, Dong (University of Transport Technology, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam;, banglh@utt.edu.vn, (H.-B.L.);, lanvth@utt.edu.vn, (H.-L.T.V.);, binhpt@utt.edu.vn, (B.T.P.)); Ly, Hai-Bang (University of Transport Technology, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam;, banglh@utt.edu.vn, (H.-B.L.);, lanvth@utt.edu.vn, (H.-L.T.V.);, binhpt@utt.edu.vn, (B.T.P.)); Vu, Huong-Lan Thi (University of Transport Technology, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam;, banglh@utt.edu.vn, (H.-B.L.);, lanvth@utt.edu.vn, (H.-L.T.V.);, binhpt@utt.edu.vn, (B.T.P.)); Le, Tien-Thinh (Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam); Pham, Binh Thai (University of Transport Technology, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam;, banglh@utt.edu.vn, (H.-B.L.);, lanvth@utt.edu.vn, (H.-L.T.V.);, binhpt@utt.edu.vn, (B.T.P.))","Van Dao, Dong (University of Transport Technology); Le, Tien-Thinh (Duy Tan University)","Van Dao, Dong (University of Transport Technology); Ly, Hai-Bang (University of Transport Technology); Vu, Huong-Lan Thi (University of Transport Technology); Le, Tien-Thinh (Duy Tan University); Pham, Binh Thai (University of Transport Technology)",57,39,4.43,19.39,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7084645?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125303237,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Water with TDG supersaturation can negatively impact fish, aquatic invertebrates and their habitats. This study comprehensively reviewed the physical mechanisms of TDG generation and predictive TDG generation models at various facility types. To establish TDG mitigation strategies, it is essential to develop predictive tools for TDG generation that consider both facility geometry as well as the hydrology of the downstream environment. Applications of TDG prediction at different discharge modes included plunging flows, trajectory jets, plunging jets, free-falling jets, and submerged jets were discussed. TDG transport models in downstream rivers involving mixing and dissipation were introduced, which can be integrated with TDG generation models into a platform to describe TDG distribution in river systems. Subsequently, risk ranking procedures for assessing the degree of TDG risk on fish were provided. Potential measures for mitigating TDG supersaturation were reviewed and included engineering, operational, and technical solutions. Outcomes from this review considered a diverse suite of studies on TDG issues in regulated rivers and allowed for recommendations to reduce uncertainties and improve environmental performance at facilities where TDG risks occur.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, instead of using it alone, clinicians often prefer to diagnose the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by utilizing a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory test, imaging measurement (e.g., chest computed tomography scan), and multivariable clinical prediction models, including the electronic nose. Here, we report on the development and use of a low cost, noninvasive method to rapidly sniff out COVID-19 based on a portable electronic nose (GeNose C19) integrating an array of metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors, optimized feature extraction, and machine learning models. This approach was evaluated in profiling tests involving a total of 615 breath samples composed of 333 positive and 282 negative samples. The samples were obtained from 43 positive and 40 negative COVID-19 patients, respectively, and confirmed with RT-qPCR at two hospitals located in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Four different machine learning algorithms (i.e., linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, stacked multilayer perceptron, and deep neural network) were utilized to identify the top-performing pattern recognition methods and to obtain a high system detection accuracy (88–95%), sensitivity (86–94%), and specificity (88–95%) levels from the testing datasets. Our results suggest that GeNose C19 can be considered a highly potential breathalyzer for fast COVID-19 screening.","This work was funded in part by the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency (BIN) under grant agreements no. 5471/UN1.P.V/DIT-KAUI/HK/2020 and PK-008/IX/2020, in part by the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency (Kemenristek/BRIN) and Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) within the project of “E-nose COVID-19: Electronic Nose Innovation for COVID-19 Screening in Indonesia” under grant agreement no. 10/FI/P-KCOVID-19.2B3/X/2020, and in part by Directorate of Business Development and Incubation (PUI) at Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) with project no. 1687/UN1.P.V/DIT-PUI/KA/2020.

This study aimed to propose a novel prediction model to improve accuracy in landslide prediction, based on the combination of multiple new algorithms. The proposed new method includes three parts: data preparation, multi-swarm intelligence (MSI) optimization, and displacement prediction. In the data preparation, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) is adopted to separate the trend and periodic displacements from the observed cumulative landslide displacement. The frequency component and residual component of reconstructed inducing factors that related to landslide movements are also extracted by the CEEMD and t-test, and then picked out with edit distance on real sequence (EDR) as input variables for the support vector regression (SVR) model. MSI optimization algorithms are used to optimize the SVR model in the MSI optimization; thus, six predictions models can be obtained that can be used in the displacement prediction part. Finally, the trend and periodic displacements are predicted by six optimized SVR models, respectively. The trend displacement and periodic displacement with the highest prediction accuracy are added and regarded as the final prediction result. The case study of the Shiliushubao landslide shows that the prediction results match the observed data well with an improvement in the aspect of average relative error, which indicates that the proposed model can predict landslide displacements with high precision, even when the displacements are characterized by stepped curves that under the influence of multiple time-varying factors.",The authors gratefully appreciate the editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive criticism and comments on the earlier version of this paper and for offering valuable suggestions that have helped to improve this paper.,,Sensors,,,2021-12-14,2021,2021-12-14,,21,24,8352,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Junrong; Tang, Huiming; Tannant, Dwayne D.; Lin, Chengyuan; Xia, Ding; Wang, Yankun; Wang, Qianyun","Zhang, Junrong (Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China;, zjr@cug.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, chengyuanlin@cug.edu.cn, (C.L.);, cug_xia@cug.edu.cn, (D.X.)); Tang, Huiming (Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China;, zjr@cug.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, chengyuanlin@cug.edu.cn, (C.L.);, cug_xia@cug.edu.cn, (D.X.); Three Gorges Research Center for Geohazards of Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China;, wangqianyun@cug.edu.cn; Badong National Observation and Research Station of Geohazards, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China); Tannant, Dwayne D.

To improve the accuracy of Chl-a index prediction, a novel hybrid water quality prediction method was proposed for gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network based on particle swarm algorithm optimized variational modal decomposition (PV-GRU). The results showed that the variational mode decomposition (VMD) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) in this study effectively reduced the non-smooth of water quality data. In addition, the GRU neural network reduced the risk of overfitting the deep-learning model with small sample data. Overall, the PV-GRU prediction model exhibited significant superiority in predicting non-smooth and non-linear Chl-a sequences with a relatively small sample size. The prediction errors of PV-GRU model were all less than those of other comparative models, and the fitting determination coefficient R2 was 94.21%.

The purpose of the study was to develop and train a neural network and an ensemble model to predict the mechanical properties of lightweight fiber-reinforced concrete using the accumulated empirical database and data from construction industry enterprises, and to improve production processes in the construction industry. The study applied deep learning and an ensemble of regression trees. The empirical base is the result of testing a series of experimental compositions of fiber-reinforced concrete. The predicted properties are cubic compressive strength, prismatic compressive strength, flexural tensile strength, and axial tensile strength. The quantitative picture of the accuracy of the applied methods for strength characteristics varies for the deep neural network method from 0.15 to 0.73 (MAE), from 0.17 to 0.89 (RMSE), and from 0.98% to 6.62% (MAPE), and for the ensemble of regression trees, from 0.11 to 0.62 (MAE), from 0.15 to 0.80 (RMSE), and from 1.30% to 3.4% (MAPE). Both methods have shown high efficiency in relation to such a hard-to-predict material as concrete, which is so heterogeneous in structure and depends on many factors. The value of the developed models lies in the possibility of obtaining additional useful information in the process of preparing highly functional lightweight fiber-reinforced concrete without additional experiments.",The authors would like to acknowledge the administration of Don State Technical University for their resources and financial support.,This research received no external funding.,Materials,,,2022-09-28,2022,2022-09-28,,15,19,6740,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stel’makh, Sergey A.; Shcherban’, Evgenii M.; Beskopylny, Alexey N.; Mailyan, Levon R.; Meskhi, Besarion; Razveeva, Irina; Kozhakin, Alexey; Beskopylny, Nikita","Stel’makh, Sergey A.

Conventionally scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and sometimes additional analytical techniques are performed in order to analyze wear appearances, i.e., grooves, pittings, surface films, and others. In addition, experience is required in order to draw the correct and relevant conclusions on the acting damage and wear mechanisms from the obtained analytical data. Until now, different types of wear mechanisms are classified by experts examining the damage patterns manually. In addition to this approach based on expert knowledge, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) represents a promising alternative. Here, no expert knowledge is required, instead, the classification is done by a purely data-driven model. In this contribution, artificial neural networks are used to classify the wear mechanisms based on SEM images. In order to obtain optimal performance of the artificial neural network, a hyperparameter optimization is performed in addition. The content of this contribution is the investigation of the feasibility of an AI-based model for the automated classification of wear mechanisms.",We acknowledge support by the Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Duisburg-Essen.,,Materials,,,2022-03-22,2022,2022-03-22,,15,7,2358,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sieberg, Philipp Maximilian; Kurtulan, Dzhem; Hanke, Stefanie","Sieberg, Philipp Maximilian (Chair of Mechatronics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47051 Duisburg, Germany); Kurtulan, Dzhem (Chair of Material Science and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47051 Duisburg, Germany;, dzhem.kurtulan@uni-due.de); Hanke, Stefanie (Chair of Material Science and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47051 Duisburg, Germany;, dzhem.kurtulan@uni-due.de)","Sieberg, Philipp Maximilian (University of Duisburg-Essen); Hanke, Stefanie (University of Duisburg-Essen)","Sieberg, Philipp Maximilian (University of Duisburg-Essen); Kurtulan, Dzhem (University of Duisburg-Essen); Hanke, Stefanie (University of Duisburg-Essen)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/7/2358/pdf?version=1648005031,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146494798,40 Engineering,

This study predicted residual chlorine using six deep learning and nine machine learning techniques. Suitability of multimodel ensembles (MMEs) including arithmetic mean of all the models (Ens1), average of the best three performing models (Ens2), and weighted mean of outputs from all the 15 models was investigated. A total of nine ""goodness-of-fit"" measures (such as distance correlation (r d) and Taylor skill score) were used to rank the models. The two best deep learning methods were the nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) (r d = 0.51) and feedforward backpropagation (FFB) (r d = 0.61). The two best machine learning algorithms included random forests (RF) (r d = 0.64) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) (r d = 0.59). Eventually, Ens2 was obtained using RF, FFB, and GPR. Ens2 performed better than Ens1 and Ens3. The amount of variance explained by individual models and MMEs was over the ranges of 13-66% and 51-74%, respectively. Ens2 explained 74% of the total variance in observed residual chlorine. Remarkably, the appropriateness of the MMEs depends on the approach for combining model outputs, and the number of models considered. This study demonstrated the acceptability of statistical MMEs in predicting chlorine residual concentration in drinking water.","The author acknowledges that the datasets used in this study were based on water sampled from the Lirima Gravity Flow Scheme (LGFS) in Uganda, East Africa upon permision granted by the Research and Development Department from the Head Office of the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) in Kampala.

We first provide a brief overview of AI and consider its intuitive incorporation into the clinical workflow. We then discuss how AI can be applied for the characterization of adrenal, pancreatic, pituitary and thyroid masses in order to support clinicians in their diagnostic interpretations. This Review also puts forth a number of key evaluation criteria for machine learning in medicine that physicians can use in their appraisals of these algorithms. We identify mitigation strategies to address ongoing challenges around data availability and model interpretability in the context of endocrine cancer diagnosis.

Posing unique properties and promising removal capacity, ionic liquids (ILs) are potential media for H2S capture. Engineering design of such absorption process needs accurate measurements or reliable estimation of the H2S solubility in ILs. Since experimental measurements are time-consuming and expensive, this study utilizes machine learning methods to monitor H2S solubility in fifteen various ILs accurately. Six robust machine learning methods, including adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), radial basis function, cascade, multilayer perceptron, and generalized regression neural networks, are implemented/compared. A vast experimental databank comprising 792 datasets was utilized. Temperature, pressure, acentric factor, critical pressure, and critical temperature of investigated ILs are the affecting parameters of our models. Sensitivity and statistical error analysis were utilized to assess the performance and accuracy of the proposed models. The calculated solubility data and the derived models were validated using seven statistical criteria. The obtained results showed that the LS-SVM accurately predicts H2S solubility in ILs and possesses R2, RMSE, MSE, RRSE, RAE, MAE, and AARD of 0.99798, 0.01079, 0.00012, 6.35%, 4.35%, 0.0060, and 4.03, respectively. It was found that the H2S solubility adversely relates to the temperature and directly depends on the pressure. Furthermore, the combination of OMIM+ and Tf2N-, i.e., [OMIM][Tf2N] ionic liquid, is the best choice for H2S capture among the investigated absorbents. The H2S solubility in this ionic liquid can reach more than 0.8 in terms of mole fraction.",The authors are thankful to the Shahrood University of Technology for the support.,,Scientific Reports,,"Hydrogen Sulfide; Imidazoles; Ionic Liquids; Neural Networks, Computer; Solubility",2022-03-15,2022,2022-03-15,,12,1,4415,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abdi, Jafar; Hadipoor, Masoud; Esmaeili-Faraj, Seyyed Hamid; Vaferi, Behzad","Abdi, Jafar (Faculty of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Iran); Hadipoor, Masoud (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum Engineering, Petroleum University of Technology (PUT), Ahwaz, Iran); Esmaeili-Faraj, Seyyed Hamid (Faculty of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Iran); Vaferi, Behzad (Department of Chemical Engineering, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran)","Vaferi, Behzad (Islamic Azad University of Shiraz)","Abdi, Jafar (University of Shahrood); Hadipoor, Masoud (Petroleum University of Technology); Esmaeili-Faraj, Seyyed Hamid (University of Shahrood); Vaferi, Behzad (Islamic Azad University of Shiraz)",7,7,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08304-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146280530,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,13 Climate Action

This study uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique to develop the best model fits to predict water quality parameters by employing multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, using data collected from three district municipalities. Two input combination models, MLP-4-5-4 and MLP-4-9-4, were trained, verified, and tested for their predictive performance ability, and their physicochemical prediction accuracy was compared by using each model's observed data with the predicted data. The MLP-4-5-4 model showed a better understanding of the data sets and water quality predictive ability giving an MSE of 39.06589 and a correlation coefficient (R2) of the observed and the predicted water quality of 0.989383 compared to the MLP-4-9-4 model (R2 = 0.993532, MSE = 39.03087). These results apply to natural water resources management in South Africa and similar catchment systems.

7644,pub.1138346112,10.2166/wst.2021.203,34850695,,An emergent addition for the optimal systemization of wastewater utilization plants using artificial intelligence,"The treatment of wastewater is an essential factor in preventing pollutants and promoting the quality of the water. The inherent complexity, influential impact and the solid waste infrastructure all lead to confusion and variance in the primary clarifier for wastewater. These inconsistencies lead to variations in the purity and capacity constraints of wastewater and the existential impact of water receipt. Water treatment is a complicated task that has chemical, technical and biochemical aspects. A credible artificial neural network (ANN) method is necessary for another wastewater treatment plant to prevent the breakdown of the processes. Virtual reality seems to have become a strong solution for preventing waste management uncertainties and problems. This is not only due to extreme changes but also to significant external disturbances that water systems are subjected to when controlling challenges. Climate is among the most significant of such disturbances. Various environmental conditions actually include different influx frequencies and levels of substances. Water contamination has become one of the extremely serious growing concerns; sewage treatment plant identification is a key major issue here and the agencies enforce tighter requirements when operating wastewater software systems. This article plans to create models of achievement and prospects when possible future guidance of recent research borders for the use of artificial intelligence in wastewater treatment plants that concurrently deal with pollutants. This study has shown us that the composite ANN provides a greater level of competence in plant prediction and systemization.","The authors thankfully acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for funding the research grant number RGP.1/174/42.",,Water Science & Technology,,"Artificial Intelligence; Neural Networks, Computer; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",2021-05-25,2021,2021-05-25,2021-11-15,84,10-11,2805-2817,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hasan, Mohd Abul","Hasan, Mohd Abul (Civil Engineering Department, College of Engineering, King Khalid University, P.O.

One of the main well design programs is the mud program, which plays a crucial role in each drilling operation. Researchers focus on modeling the rheological properties of the drilling fluid seeking for accurate and real-time predictions that confirm its crucial potential as a research point. However, only substantial studies have real impact on the literature. Several AI-based models have been proposed for estimating mud rheological properties. However, most of them suffer from non-being field applicable attractive due to using non-readily field parameters as input variables. Some other studies have not provided a comprehensive description of the model to replicate or reproduce results using other datasets. In this study, two novel robust artificial neural network (ANN) models for estimating invert emulsion mud plastic viscosity and yield point have been developed using actual field data based on 407 datasets. These datasets include mud plastic viscosity (PV), yield point (YP), mud temperature (T), marsh funnel viscosity (MF), and solid content. The mathematical base of each model has been provided to provide a clear means for models' replicability. Results of the evaluation criteria depicted the outstanding performance and consistency of the proposed models over extant ANN models and empirical correlations. Statistical evaluation revealed that the plastic viscosity ANN model has a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 98.82%, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.37, an average relative error (ARE) of 0.12, and an absolute average relative error of 2.69, while for yield point, this model has a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 94%, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.76, an average relative error (ARE) of -0.67, and an absolute average relative error of 3.18.",,,ACS Omega,,,2021-11-24,2021,2021-11-24,2021-12-07,6,48,32948-32959,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gouda, Abdelrahman; Khaled, Samir; Gomaa, Sayed; Attia, Attia M.","Gouda, Abdelrahman (Petroleum Engineering and Gas Technology Department, Faculty of Energy and Environmental Engineering, The British University in Egypt, El Shorouk City, Cairo, 11837, Egypt); Khaled, Samir (Petroleum Engineering and Gas Technology Department, Faculty of Energy and Environmental Engineering, The British University in Egypt, El Shorouk City, Cairo, 11837, Egypt; Mining and Petroleum Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Al-Azhar University, Nasr City, Cairo, 11371, Egypt); Gomaa, Sayed (Petroleum Engineering and Gas Technology Department, Faculty of Energy and Environmental Engineering, The British University in Egypt, El Shorouk City, Cairo, 11837, Egypt; Mining and Petroleum Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Al-Azhar University, Nasr City, Cairo, 11371, Egypt); Attia, Attia M.

Although various machine learning (ML) models have been developed for coastal water quality estimation using remote sensing data, the performance of these models has significant uncertainties when applied to regional scales. To address this issue, an ensemble ML-based model was developed in this study. The ensemble ML model was applied to estimate chlorophyll-a (Chla), turbidity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) based on Sentinel-2 satellite images in Shenzhen Bay, China. The optimal input features for each WQP were selected from eight spectral bands and seven spectral indices. A local explanation strategy termed Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was employed to quantify contributions of each feature to model outputs. In addition, the impacts of three climate factors on the variation of each WQP were analyzed. The results suggested that the ensemble ML models have satisfied performance for Chla (errors = 1.7%), turbidity (errors = 1.5%) and DO estimation (errors = 0.02%). Band 3 (B3) has the highest positive contribution to Chla estimation, while Band Ration Index2 (BR2) has the highest negative contribution to turbidity estimation, and Band 7 (B7) has the highest positive contribution to DO estimation. The spatial patterns of the three WQPs revealed that the water quality deterioration in Shenzhen Bay was mainly influenced by input of terrestrial pollutants from the estuary. Correlation analysis demonstrated that air temperature (Temp) and average air pressure (AAP) exhibited the closest relationship with Chla. DO showed the strongest negative correlation with Temp, while turbidity was not sensitive to Temp, average wind speed (AWS), and AAP. Overall, the ensemble ML model proposed in this study provides an accurate and practical method for long-term Chla, turbidity, and DO estimation in coastal waters.",The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Key RD Program of China for this research under grant number 2016YFC04007009.

First, we developed the prediction models for metabolic stability, CYP inhibition, and P-gp and BCRP substrate recognition using 265 physicochemical parameters for designing the molecular structures. Four important parameters, including the well-known indicator h_logD, are common in some in vitro studies; as such, these can be used to optimize compounds simultaneously to address multiple pharmacokinetic concerns. Next, we developed machine learning models that had been programmed to show structurally active sites. Many types of machine learning models were developed using the results of in vitro metabolic stability study of around 30000 in-house compounds. The metabolic sites of in-house compounds predicted using some prediction models matched experimentally identified metabolically active sites, with a ratio of number of metabolic sites (predicted/actual) of over 90%. These models can be applied to several screening projects. These two approaches can be employed for obtaining lead compounds with desirable pharmacokinetic profiles efficiently.","The authors would like to thank Tomoya Inaba, Yui Migura, Kazuya Yamaguchi, Masamichi Shirakura, Tomonori Mori, and Naoya Uematsu of the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; Takashi Ishizaki of the Dassault Systèmes KK; Isao Sugawara and Shinpei Ijichi of the DataRobot, Inc.; and Mitsuhashi Toshiya of the NS Solutions Corporation for their valuable support.","This study did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics,,"Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Drug Design; Drug Discovery; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Predictive Value of Tests; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship",2021-05-03,2021,2021-05-03,2021-08,39,,100401,Closed,Article,"Sasahara, Katsunori; Shibata, Masakazu; Sasabe, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Tomoki; Takeuchi, Kenji; Umehara, Ken; Kashiyama, Eiji","Sasahara, Katsunori (Tokushima Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 463-10 Kagasuno, Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima, 771-0192, Japan.

Nevertheless, the traditional ESN is intrinsically a supervised learning technique, which only depends on labeled samples, but omits a large number of unlabeled samples. In order to eliminate this limitation, this work proposes a semi-supervised ESN method assisted by a temporal-spatial graph regularization (TSG-SSESN) for constructing soft sensor model with all the available samples. Firstly, the traditional supervised ESN is enhanced to construct the semi-supervised ESN (SSESN) model by integrating both unlabeled and labeled samples in the reservoir computing procedure. The SSESN computes the reservoir states under high sampling rate for better process dynamic information mining. Furthermore, the SSESN's output optimization objective is modified by applying the local adjacency graph of all training samples as a regularization term. Especially, in view of the dynamic data characteristic, a temporal-spatial graph is constructed by considering both the temporal relationship and the spatial distances. The applications to a debutanizer column process and a wastewater treatment plant demonstrate that the TSG-SSESN model can build much smoother model and has better generalization capability than the basic ESN models in terms of soft sensor prediction results.","This work was supported by the Opening Fund of National Engineering Laboratory of Offshore Geophysical and Exploration Equipment, China, that is, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China under Grant Nos. 20CX02322 A and 20CX02310A, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 62173344, the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China under Grant No. ZR2020MF093, and the Major Scientific and Technological Projects of CNPC, China (Grant No. ZD2019-183-003)",,ISA Transactions,,,2022-04-13,2022,2022-04-13,2022-11,130,,306-315,Closed,Article,"Wang, Ping; Yin, Yichao; Deng, Xiaogang; Bo, Yingchun; Shao, Weiming","Wang, Ping (College of Control Science and Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao 266580, China.); Yin, Yichao (College of Control Science and Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao 266580, China.); Deng, Xiaogang (College of Control Science and Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao 266580, China.

The widespread use of digital pathology has been due to the advent of whole slide imaging. Cheaper storage for digital images, along with unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence, have paved the synergy of these two fields. This has pushed the limits of traditional diagnosis using light microscopy, from a more subjective to a more objective method of looking at cases, incorporating grading too. The grading of histopathological images of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder is important with direct implications for surgical management and prognosis. In this study, the aim is to classify urothelial carcinoma into low and high grade based on the WHO 2016 classification. The hematoxylin and eosin-stained transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) samples of both low and high grade non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma were digitally scanned. Patches were extracted from these whole slide images to feed into a deep learning (Convolution Neural Network: CNN) model. Patches were segregated if they had tumor tissue and only included for model training if a threshold of 90% of tumor tissue per patch was seen. Various parameters of the deep learning model, known as hyperparameters, were optimized to get the best accuracy for grading or classification into low- and high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The model was robust with an overall accuracy of 90% after hyperparameter tuning. Visualization in the form of a class activation map using Grad-CAM was done. This indicates that such a model can be used as a companion diagnostic tool for grading of urothelial carcinoma. The probable causes of this accuracy are summarized along with the limitations of this study and future work possible.",Declaration of interests The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Pathology Informatics,,,2022-11-08,2022,2022-11-08,2023,14,,100155,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mundhada, Aniruddha; Sundaram, Sandhya; Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan; Cruze, Lawrence D'; Govindarajan, Satyavratan; Makaram, Navaneethakrishna","Mundhada, Aniruddha (Department of Pathology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India); Sundaram, Sandhya (Department of Pathology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India); Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan (Biomedical Engineering, Department of Applied Mechanics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India); Cruze, Lawrence D' (Department of Pathology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India); Govindarajan, Satyavratan (Biomedical Engineering, Department of Applied Mechanics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India); Makaram, Navaneethakrishna (Biomedical Engineering, Department of Applied Mechanics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India)","Mundhada, Aniruddha (Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research); Sundaram, Sandhya (Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research)","Mundhada, Aniruddha (Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research); Sundaram, Sandhya (Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research); Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan (Indian Institute of Technology Madras); Cruze, Lawrence D' (Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research); Govindarajan, Satyavratan (Indian Institute of Technology Madras); Makaram, Navaneethakrishna (Indian Institute of Technology Madras)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpi.2022.100155,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152577211,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

Patient trajectories are highly predictive of the future course of diseases and therefore facilitate effective care. However, digital medicine often uses only limited patient data, consisting of health events from only a single or small number of time points while ignoring additional information encoded in patient trajectories. To analyze such rich longitudinal data, new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are needed. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent efforts to develop trajectory-aware AI solutions and provide suggestions for future directions. Specifically, we examine the implications for developing disease models from patient trajectories along the typical workflow in AI: problem definition, data processing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation. We conclude with a discussion of how such AI solutions will allow the field to build robust models for personalized risk scoring, subtyping, and disease pathway discovery.",SF received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 186932).

The associated morbidity and mortality of cerebrospinal tumors are disproportionately high compared to other malignancies. While minimally invasive techniques have initiated a revolution in neurosurgery, artificial intelligence (AI) is expediting it. Our study aims to analyze AI's role in the neurosurgical management of cerebrospinal tumors. We conducted a scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Upon screening, data extraction and analysis were focused on exploring all potential implications of AI, classification of these implications in the management of cerebrospinal tumors. AI has enhanced the precision of diagnosis of these tumors, enables surgeons to excise the tumor margins completely, thereby reducing the risk of recurrence, and helps to make a more accurate prediction of the patient's prognosis than the conventional methods. AI also offers real-time training to neurosurgeons using virtual and 3D simulation, thereby increasing their confidence and skills during procedures. In addition, robotics is integrated into neurosurgery and identified to increase patient outcomes by making surgery less invasive. Artificial intelligence, including machine learning, is rigorously considered for its applications in the neurosurgical management of cerebrospinal tumors.

This problem is greatly affecting the downhole tools (wear and tear), hole problems (wash-out), mechanical energy loss, and ineffective drilling performance. Extra non-productive time to address these complications during the operation, and hence, extra cost. Detecting the drillstring vibrations during drilling through the downhole sensors is costly due to the extra service and downhole sensors. Currently, the new-technology-based solutions are providing huge capabilities to deal intelligently with the data, and machine learning applications provide high computational competencies to learn and correlate the parameters for technical complex problems. This research presented a successful case study for developing machine learning models through a comprehensive methodology process for vibration detection using surface rig data through data collection, preprocessing, analytics, training and optimizing the models’ parameters, and evaluating the performance to have the best prediction results. Evaluating the models’ performance showed that obtained predictions have a great match with actual measurements for the different stages of training, testing, and even during models’ validation with unseen well data. Real-field horizontal drilling data was utilized to feed and train the models through different tools named radial basis function (RBF), support vector machines (SVMs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and functional networks (FN) to auto-detect the three types of downhole vibrations (axial, torsional, and lateral). The study results showed a high correlation coefficient (higher than 0.9) and technically accepted average absolute percentage error (below 7.5%) between actual readings and predictions of the developed ML models. The study outcomes will add to the automation process of drilling operations to avoid many tools failure by comparing predicted vibrations versus downhole tools limits such as red zone and continuing drilling without interruption to the well total depth especially while drilling horizontal sections.",The authors wish to acknowledge King Fahd University of Petroleum for permitting the publication of this work.,,Scientific Reports,,,2023-04-17,2023,2023-04-17,,13,1,6204,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saadeldin, Ramy; Gamal, Hany; Elkatatny, Salaheldin","Saadeldin, Ramy (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Box: 5049, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Gamal, Hany (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Box: 5049, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (Department of Petroleum Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Box: 5049, 31261, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia)","Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)","Saadeldin, Ramy (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Gamal, Hany (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals); Elkatatny, Salaheldin (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33411-9.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157283808,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Replay was first observed in biological neural networks during sleep, and it is now thought to play a critical role in memory formation, retrieval, and consolidation. Replay-like mechanisms have been incorporated in deep artificial neural networks that learn over time to avoid catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. Replay algorithms have been successfully used in a wide range of deep learning methods within supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms. In this letter, we provide the first comprehensive comparison between replay in the mammalian brain and replay in artificial neural networks. We identify multiple aspects of biological replay that are missing in deep learning systems and hypothesize how they could be used to improve artificial neural networks.","T.H. and C.K. were supported in part by the DARPA/SRI Lifelong Learning Machines program (HR0011-18-C-0051), AFOSR grant (FA9550-18-1-0121), and NSF award 1909696.

The novel geographic information web (GIW) application is proposed for dynamically predicting landslide risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The automated GIW system is coordinated between machine learning technologies, web technologies, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The new bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithm is presented to forecast landslides. The proposed algorithm consists of 3 major steps, the first of which is the construction of a landslide dataset by using Quantum GIS (QGIS). The second step is to generate the landslide-risk model based on machine learning approaches. Finally, the automated landslide-risk visualization illustrates the likelihood of landslide via Google Maps on the website. Four static factors are considered for landslide-risk prediction, namely, land cover, soil properties, elevation and slope, and a single dynamic factor i.e., precipitation. Data are collected to construct a geospatial landslide database which comprises three historical landslide locations-Phu Chifa at Thoeng District, Ban Pha Duea at Mae Salong Nai, and Mai Salong Nok in Mae Fa Luang District, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Data collection is achieved using QGIS software to interpolate contour, elevation, slope degree and land cover from the Google satellite images, aerial and site survey photographs while the physiographic and rock type are on-site surveyed by experts. The state-of-the-art machine learning models have been trained i.e., linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. Ablation studies have been conducted to determine the optimal parameters setting for each model. An enhancement method based on two-stage classifications has been presented to improve the landslide prediction of LSTM and Bi-LSTM models. The landslide-risk prediction performances of these models are subsequently evaluated using real-time dataset and it is shown that Bi-LSTM with Random Forest (Bi-LSTM-RF) yields the best prediction performance. Bi-LSTM-RF model has improved the landslide-risk predicting performance over LR, ANNs, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM in terms of the area under the receiver characteristic operator (AUC) scores by 0.42, 0.27, 0.46, and 0.47, respectively. Finally, an automated web GIS has been developed and it consists of software components including the trained models, rainfall API, Google API, and geodatabase.

Computer vision-based automated anomaly detection techniques replace human intervention to secure video surveillance applications in place from traditional video surveillance systems that rely on human involvement for anomaly detection, which is tedious and inaccurate. Due to the diverse nature of anomalous events and their complexity, it is however, very challenging to detect them automatically in a real-world scenario. By using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), this research work presents an efficient and robust framework for detecting anomalies in surveillance large video data. A hybrid model integrating 2D-CNN and ESN are proposed in this research study for smart surveillance, which is an important application of AIoT. The CNN is used as feature extractor from input videos which are then inputted to autoencoder for feature refinement followed by ESN for sequence learning and anomalous events detection. The proposed model is lightweight and implemented over edge devices to ensure their capability and applicability over AIoT environments in a smart city. The proposed model significantly enhanced performance using challenging surveillance datasets compared to other methods.","The authors would like to thank the STC Academy, Riyadh for supporting of this research work.",This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,,2023-02-20,2023,2023-02-20,,23,4,2358,All OA; Gold,Article,"Islam, Muhammad; Dukyil, Abdulsalam S.; Alyahya, Saleh; Habib, Shabana","Islam, Muhammad (Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering and Information Technology, Onaizah Colleges, Onaizah 2053, Saudi Arabia); Dukyil, Abdulsalam S.

However, we see a major resurgence in the use of modern ML methods in scientific research during the last few years. These methods have had phenomenal success in the areas of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), etc. This has inspired chemists and biologists to apply these algorithms to problems in natural sciences. Availability of high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators, large datasets, new algorithms, and libraries has enabled this surge. ML algorithms have successfully been applied to various domains in molecular sciences by providing much faster and sometimes more accurate solutions compared to traditional methods like Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations, Density Functional Theory (DFT) or Molecular Mechanics (MM) based methods, etc. Some of the areas where the potential of ML methods are shown to be effective are in drug design, prediction of high–level quantum mechanical energies, molecular design, molecular dynamics materials, and retrosynthesis of organic compounds, etc. This article intends to conceptually introduce various modern ML methods and their relevance and applications in computational natural sciences.Graphical abstractSynopsis Recent surge in the application of machine learning (ML) methods in fundamental sciences has led to a perspective that these methods may become important tools in chemical science.

Therefore, the detection of brain tumors at an early stage improves the impact of treatments and increases the patients survival rates. However, detecting brain tumors in their initial stages is a demanding task and an unmet need.
METHODS: The present study presents a comprehensive review of the recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of diagnosing brain tumors using MRI images. These AI techniques can be divided into Supervised, Unsupervised, and Deep Learning (DL) methods.
RESULTS: Diagnosing and segmenting brain tumors usually begin with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) on the brain since MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique. Another existing challenge is that the growth of technology is faster than the rate of increase in the number of medical staff who can employ these technologies. It has resulted in an increased risk of diagnostic misinterpretation. Therefore, developing robust automated brain tumor detection techniques has been studied widely over the past years.
CONCLUSION: The current review provides an analysis of the performance of modern methods in this area. Moreover, various image segmentation methods in addition to the recent efforts of researchers are summarized. Finally, the paper discusses open questions and suggests directions for future research.","This publication has emanated from research [conducted with the financial support of/supported in part by a grant from Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number No. 18/CRT/6183 and is supported by the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology which is funded under the SFI Research Centres Programme (Grant 13/RC/2106/_P2), Lero SFI Centre for Software (Grant 13/RC/2094/_P2) and is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund.

Water quality has been deteriorating at an alarming rate as a direct result of rapid industrialization and urbanisation, which has led to a rise in the prevalence of serious diseases. In the past, determining the quality of water was typically accomplished by employing labor-intensive, time-consuming, and statistically pricey laboratory investigations, which renders the prevalent concept of real-time monitoring meaningless. The worrisome effect of poor water quality mandates the necessity of an alternative model that is both rapid and economical to implement. There has been a lot of talk about using artificial intelligence to forecast and model water quality as a means of preventing and reducing water pollution. An artificial ecosystem optimization with Deep Learning Enabled Water Quality Prediction and Classification (AEODL-WQPC) model is presented in this paper. The primary objectives of the AEODL-WQPC model that is being given are the prediction and categorization of different levels of water quality. As a first processing step, the data normalization technique is used to the provided AEODL-WQPC model so that this goal can be achieved. In addition to this, an optimal stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (OSBiGRU) model is used to forecast the water quality index (WQI), and the Adam optimizer is utilised in order to fine-tune the model's parameters. AEO with enhanced Elman Neural Network (AEO-IENN) model is utilised for the categorization of water quality. This model is characterized by the fact that the AEO algorithm effectively tunes the parameters associated to the ENN model. For the purposes of the experimental validation of the AEODL-WQPC model, a benchmark water quality dataset obtained from the Kaggle repository is utilised. The research that compared several models found that the AEODL-WQPC model had superior results to more recent state of the art methods.","This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, under grant No. (D-126-135-1443).

The aim of this article is to help readers develop various applications of DL. DL has made a large impact on the literature of many medical sciences, including MR. However, its technical details are not easily understandable for non-experts of machine learning (ML).The first part of this article presents an overview of DL and its related technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and ML. AI is explained as a function that can receive many inputs and produce many outputs. ML is a process of fitting the function to training data. DL is a kind of ML, which uses a composite of many functions to approximate the function of interest. This composite function is called a deep neural network (DNN), and the functions composited into a DNN are called layers. This first part also covers the underlying technologies required for DL, such as loss functions, optimization, initialization, linear layers, non-linearities, normalization, recurrent neural networks, regularization, data augmentation, residual connections, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, model and data sizes, and complex-valued neural networks.The second part of this article presents an overview of the applications of DL in MR and explains how functions represented as DNNs are applied to various applications, such as RF pulse, pulse sequence, reconstruction, motion correction, spectroscopy, parameter mapping, image synthesis, and segmentation.",The author would like to thank Kensuke Shinoda and Yutaka Hoshiyama for providing a cardiac image used in Fig. 1.

Prognostics and health management (PHM) is the discipline that links the studies of failure mechanisms to system lifecycle management. There is a need, which is still absent, to produce an analytical compilation of PHM-XAI works. In this paper, we use preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to present a state of the art on XAI applied to PHM of industrial assets. This work provides an overview of the trend of XAI in PHM and answers the question of accuracy versus explainability, considering the extent of human involvement, explanation assessment, and uncertainty quantification in this topic. Research articles associated with the subject, since 2015 to 2021, were selected from five databases following the PRISMA methodology, several of them related to sensors. The data were extracted from selected articles and examined obtaining diverse findings that were synthesized as follows. First, while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicates a growing acceptance of XAI in PHM. Second, XAI offers dual advantages, where it is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks and explain diagnostic and anomaly detection activities, implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Third, the review shows that PHM-XAI papers provide interesting results, suggesting that the PHM performance is unaffected by the XAI. Fourth, human role, evaluation metrics, and uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM community. Adequate assessment metrics to cater to PHM needs are requested. Finally, most case studies featured in the considered articles are based on real industrial data, and some of them are related to sensors, showing that the available PHM-XAI blends solve real-world challenges, increasing the confidence in the artificial intelligence models' adoption in the industry.",,,Sensors,,Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Prognosis,2021-12-01,2021,2021-12-01,,21,23,8020,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nor, Ahmad Kamal Mohd; Pedapati, Srinivasa Rao; Muhammad, Masdi; Leiva, Víctor","Nor, Ahmad Kamal Mohd (Mechanical Department, Universiti Teknologi Petronas, Seri Iskandar 32610, Malaysia;, srinivasa.pedapati@utp.edu.my, (S.R.P.);, masdimuhammad@utp.edu.my, (M.M.)); Pedapati, Srinivasa Rao (Mechanical Department, Universiti Teknologi Petronas, Seri Iskandar 32610, Malaysia;, srinivasa.pedapati@utp.edu.my, (S.R.P.);, masdimuhammad@utp.edu.my, (M.M.)); Muhammad, Masdi (Mechanical Department, Universiti Teknologi Petronas, Seri Iskandar 32610, Malaysia;, srinivasa.pedapati@utp.edu.my, (S.R.P.);, masdimuhammad@utp.edu.my, (M.M.)); Leiva, Víctor (School of Industrial Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2362807, Chile;, victor.leiva@pucv.cl)","Nor, Ahmad Kamal Mohd ","Nor, Ahmad Kamal Mohd (); Pedapati, Srinivasa Rao (); Muhammad, Masdi (); Leiva, Víctor (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)",15,15,0.43,10.18,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/23/8020/pdf?version=1638864715,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143560141,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

However, despite its promising advantages, its transition into clinical settings remains slow. To make the vital leap to mainstream clinical practice and improve patient care, 3DP must harness modern technologies. Machine learning (ML), an influential branch of artificial intelligence, may be a key partner for 3DP. Together, 3DP and ML can utilise intelligence based on human learning to accelerate drug product development, ensure stringent quality control (QC), and inspire innovative dosage-form design. With ML's capabilities, streamlined 3DP drug delivery could mark the next era of personalised medicine.

It is believed that, automated systems based on artificial intelligence would allow the early diagnostic which increases significantly the chances of proper treatment and survival. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved human-level performance in object classification tasks, the regular growing of the amount of medical data and the continuous increase of the number of classes make them difficult to learn new tasks without being re-trained from scratch. Nevertheless, fine tuning and transfer learning in deep models are techniques that lead to the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, an Incremental Deep Tree (IDT) framework for biological image classification is proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting of CNNs allowing them to learn new classes while maintaining acceptable accuracies on the previously learnt ones. To evaluate the performance of our approach, the IDT framework is compared against with three popular incremental methods, namely iCaRL, LwF and SupportNet.

Very often the combined kernel is formed as a linear composition of multiple base kernels where the combination weights are learned from the data. As the first application of an MKF approach in hydrological modeling, lake water depth as one of the pivot factors in the reservoir analysis is simulated by considering different hydro-meteorological variables. The role of each individual input parameter is initially investigated by applying a kernel regression approach. We then illustrate the utility of an MKF formalism which learns kernel combination of weights to yield an optimal composition for kernel regression. A set of 40-year data collected from 27 groundwater and streamflow stations and 7 meteorological stations for precipitation and evaporation parameters in the vicinity of Lake Urmia are utilized for model development. Both visual and quantitative statistical performance criteria illustrate a superior performance for the MKF approach compared to kernel ridge regression (KRR), the support vector regression (SVR), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and auto regressive (AR) models. More specifically, while each individual input parameter fails to provide an accurate prediction for lake water depth modeling, an optimal combination of all input parameters incorporating the groundwater level, streamflow, precipitation and evaporation via a multiple kernel learning approach enhances the predictive performance of the model accuracy in the multiple scenarios. The promising results (RMSE = 0.098 m; R2 = 0.987; NSE = 0.986) may motivate the application of a MKF approach towards solving alternative and complex hydrological problems.",The authors want to thank Iranian Water Resources Management Company for providing the data used in this study.,,Environmental Research,,"Lakes; Neural Networks, Computer; Groundwater; Hydrology; Water",2022-11-21,2022,2022-11-21,2023-01,217,,114856,Closed,Article,"Safari, Mir Jafar Sadegh; Rahimzadeh Arashloo, Shervin; Vaheddoost, Babak","Safari, Mir Jafar Sadegh (Department of Civil Engineering, Yaşar University, Izmir, Turkey.

The terms machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are erroneously used interchangeably as they appear as monolithic nebulous entities. This technology offers immense possibilities and opportunities to advance diagnostics in the field of medicine and dentistry. This necessitates a deep understanding of AI and its essential components, such as machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN), and deep learning (DP). Aim: This review aims to enlighten clinicians regarding AI and its applications in the diagnosis of oral diseases, along with the prospects and challenges involved. Review results: AI has been used in the diagnosis of various oral diseases, such as dental caries, maxillary sinus diseases, periodontal diseases, salivary gland diseases, TMJ disorders, and oral cancer through clinical data and diagnostic images. Larger data sets would enable AI to predict the occurrence of precancerous conditions. They can aid in population-wide surveillance and decide on referrals to specialists. AI can efficiently detect microfeatures beyond the human eye and augment its predictive power in critical diagnosis. Conclusion: Although studies have recognized the benefit of AI, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has not been integrated into routine dentistry. AI is still in the research phase. The coming decade will see immense changes in diagnosis and healthcare built on the back of this research. Clinical significance: This paper reviews the various applications of AI in dentistry and illuminates the shortcomings faced while dealing with AI research and suggests ways to tackle them.

Rainfall prediction is one of the challenging tasks in weather forecasting process. Accurate rainfall prediction is now more difficult than before due to the extreme climate variations. Machine learning techniques can predict rainfall by extracting hidden patterns from historical weather data. Selection of an appropriate classification technique for prediction is a difficult job. This research proposes a novel real-time rainfall prediction system for smart cities using a machine learning fusion technique. The proposed framework uses four widely used supervised machine learning techniques, i.e., decision tree, Naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. For effective prediction of rainfall, the technique of fuzzy logic is incorporated in the framework to integrate the predictive accuracies of the machine learning techniques, also known as fusion. For prediction, 12 years of historical weather data (2005 to 2017) for the city of Lahore is considered. Pre-processing tasks such as cleaning and normalization were performed on the dataset before the classification process. The results reflect that the proposed machine learning fusion-based framework outperforms other models.",,This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,Bayes Theorem; Cities; Fuzzy Logic; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine,2022-05-04,2022,2022-05-04,,22,9,3504,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rahman, Atta-ur; Abbas, Sagheer; Gollapalli, Mohammed; Ahmed, Rashad; Aftab, Shabib; Ahmad, Munir; Khan, Muhammad Adnan; Mosavi, Amir","Rahman, Atta-ur (Department of Computer Science, College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, P.O.

Composites based on poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) have been suggested to enhance the crystallization rate and relative crystallinity of pure PLLA polymers. Despite the large amount of experimental research that has taken place to date, the theoretical aspects of relative crystallinity have not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this research uses machine learning methods to estimate the relative crystallinity of biodegradable PLLA/PGA (polyglycolide) composites. Six different artificial intelligent classes were employed to estimate the relative crystallinity of PLLA/PGA polymer composites as a function of crystallization time, temperature, and PGA content. Cumulatively, 1510 machine learning topologies, including 200 multilayer perceptron neural networks, 200 cascade feedforward neural networks (CFFNN), 160 recurrent neural networks, 800 adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, and 150 least-squares support vector regressions, were developed, and their prediction accuracy compared. The modeling results show that a single hidden layer CFFNN with 9 neurons is the most accurate method for estimating 431 experimentally measured datasets. This model predicts an experimental database with an average absolute percentage difference of 8.84%, root mean squared errors of 4.67%, and correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.999008. The modeling results and relevancy studies show that relative crystallinity increases based on the PGA content and crystallization time.

Artificial intelligence, the driving force of the current technological revolution, has been used in many frontiers, including education, security, gaming, finance, robotics, autonomous systems, entertainment, and most importantly the healthcare sector. With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, several prediction and detection methods using artificial intelligence have been employed to understand, forecast, handle, and curtail the ensuing threats. In this study, the most recent related publications, methodologies and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of studying artificial intelligence's role in the pandemic. This study presents a comprehensive review of artificial intelligence with specific attention to machine learning, deep learning, image processing, object detection, image segmentation, and few-shot learning studies that were utilized in several tasks related to COVID-19. In particular, genetic analysis, medical image analysis, clinical data analysis, sound analysis, biomedical data classification, socio-demographic data analysis, anomaly detection, health monitoring, personal protective equipment (PPE) observation, social control, and COVID-19 patients' mortality risk approaches were used in this study to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19. This study demonstrates that artificial-intelligence-based algorithms integrated into Internet of Things wearable devices were quite effective and efficient in COVID-19 detection and forecasting insights which were actionable through wide usage. The results produced by the study prove that artificial intelligence is a promising arena of research that can be applied for disease prognosis, disease forecasting, drug discovery, and to the development of the healthcare sector on a global scale. We prove that artificial intelligence indeed played a significantly important role in helping to fight against COVID-19, and the insightful knowledge provided here could be extremely beneficial for practitioners and research experts in the healthcare domain to implement the artificial-intelligence-based systems in curbing the next pandemic or healthcare disaster.",The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Asian University of Bangladesh.,This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Pandemics; COVID-19; Robotics; Algorithms,2023-01-03,2023,2023-01-03,,23,1,527,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hasan, Mahadi; Islam, Muhammad Usama; Sadeq, Muhammad Jafar; Fung, Wai-Keung; Uddin, Jasim","Hasan, Mahadi (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Asian University of Bangladesh, Ashulia 1349, Bangladesh); Islam, Muhammad Usama (School of Computing and Informatics, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA 70504, USA); Sadeq, Muhammad Jafar (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Asian University of Bangladesh, Ashulia 1349, Bangladesh); Fung, Wai-Keung (Department of Applied Computing and Engineering, Cardiff School of Technologies, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cardiff CF5 2YB, UK); Uddin, Jasim (Department of Applied Computing and Engineering, Cardiff School of Technologies, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cardiff CF5 2YB, UK)","Uddin, Jasim (Cardiff Metropolitan University)","Hasan, Mahadi (Asian University of Bangladesh); Islam, Muhammad Usama (University of Louisiana at Lafayette); Sadeq, Muhammad Jafar (Asian University of Bangladesh); Fung, Wai-Keung (Cardiff Metropolitan University); Uddin, Jasim (Cardiff Metropolitan University)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/1/527/pdf?version=1672893115,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154245435,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,3 Good Health and Well Being

Typically a ""reservoir"" is comprised of a large number of dynamical systems, and is consequently high dimensional. In this work, we use just a single simple low-dimensional dynamical system, namely, a driven pendulum, as a potential reservoir to implement reservoir computing. Remarkably we demonstrate, through numerical simulations as well as a proof-of-principle experimental realization, that one can successfully perform learning tasks using this single system. The underlying idea is to utilize the rich intrinsic dynamical patterns of the driven pendulum, especially the transient dynamics which has so far been an untapped resource. This allows even a single system to serve as a suitable candidate for a reservoir. Specifically, we analyze the performance of the single pendulum reservoir for two classes of tasks: temporal and nontemporal data processing. The accuracy and robustness of the performance exhibited by this minimal one-node reservoir in implementing these tasks strongly suggest an alternative direction in designing the reservoir layer from the point of view of efficient applications. Further, the simplicity of our learning system offers an opportunity to better understand the framework of reservoir computing in general and indicates the remarkable machine-learning potential of even a single simple nonlinear system.","M.D.S. acknowledge financial support from SERB, Department of Science and Technology (DST), India (Grant No. CRG/2021/003301).

However, due to measurement difficulties, experimental research data on sulfur solubility thus far are limited. Under the research background of small samples and poor information, a weighted least-squares support vector machine (WLSSVM)-based machine learning model suitable for a wide temperature and pressure range is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of sulfur solubility in sour gas. First, we use the comprehensive gray relational analysis method to extract important factors affecting sulfur solubility as the model input parameters. Then, we use the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) intelligence algorithms to find the optimal solution of the penalty factor and kernel coefficient and bring them into three common kernel functions. The optimal kernel function is calculated, and the final WOA-WLSSVM and GWO-WLSSVM models are established. Finally, four evaluation indicators and an outlier diagnostic method are introduced to test the proposed model's performance. The empirical results show that the WOA-WLSSVM model has better performance and reliability; the average absolute relative deviation is as low as 3.45%, determination coefficient (R 2) is as high as 0.9987, and the prediction accuracy is much higher than that of other models.",We acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China ″Research on Risk Assessment and Management of In-service Submarine Oil and Gas Transmission Pipelines″ (41877527) and Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund ″Research on Urban Natural Gas Pipeline Risk Assessment and Management under the Background of Big Data″ (2018S34).,,ACS Omega,,,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,2021-12-07,6,48,32987-32999,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Yu-Chen; Luo, Zheng-Shan; Gao, Yi-Qiong; Kong, Yu-Lei","Wang, Yu-Chen (College of Management, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710055, China); Luo, Zheng-Shan (College of Management, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710055, China); Gao, Yi-Qiong (College of Management, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710055, China); Kong, Yu-Lei (College of Management, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710055, China)","Luo, Zheng-Shan (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)","Wang, Yu-Chen (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Luo, Zheng-Shan (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Gao, Yi-Qiong (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Kong, Yu-Lei (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)",3,3,0.48,0.8,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8655918,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142736069,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

High-resolution numerical models were often used to resolve the spatial and temporal variations of exchange flows, which are computationally expensive. In this study, we adopt Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) approaches for deriving reduced order models of hydrologic exchange flows and associated transit time distributions, with integrated field observations (e.g., bathymetry) and hydrodynamic simulation data (e.g., river velocity, depth). The setup allows an improved understanding of the influences of various physical, spatial, and temporal factors on the hydrologic exchange flows and transit times. The predictors also contain those derived using hybrid clustering, leveraging our previous work on river corridor system hydromorphic classification. The machine learning-based predictive models are developed and validated along the Columbia River Corridor, and the results show that the top parameters are the thickness of the top geological formation layer, the flow regime, river velocity, and river depth; the RF and XGB models can achieve 70% to 80% accuracy and therefore are effective alternatives to the computational demanding numerical models of exchange flows and transit time distributions.

This will alleviate the energy and environmental problems that China is currently facing. The integrated development of artificial intelligence and the energy industry has become inevitable in the development of future energy systems. This study applied a comprehensive evaluation index to the energy industry to calculate the comprehensive development index of the energy industry in 30 provinces of China from 2000 to 2017. Then, taking Guangdong and Jiangsu as examples, the synthetic control method was used to explore the direction and intensity of the integrated development of artificial intelligence and the energy industry on the comprehensive development level of the local energy industry. The results showed that when artificial intelligence (AI) and the energy industry achieved a stable coupled development without the need to move to the coordination stage, the coupling effect promoted the development of the regional energy industry, and the annual growth rate of the comprehensive development index was above 20%. This coupling effect passed the placebo test and ranking test and was significant at the 10% level, indicating the robustness and validity of the experimental results, which strongly confirmed the great potential of AI in re-empowering traditional industries from the data perspective. Based on the findings, corresponding policy recommendations were proposed on how to promote the development of inter-regional AI, how the government, enterprises, and universities could cooperate to promote the coordinated development of AI and energy, and how to guide the integration process of regional AI and energy industries according to local conditions, in order to maximize the technological dividend of AI and help the construction of smart energy in China.",,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Artificial Intelligence; China; Industry; Physical Phenomena; Technology,2021-08-25,2021,2021-08-25,,18,17,8946,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dong, Feng; Zhang, Shengnan; Zhu, Jiao; Sun, Jiaojiao","Dong, Feng (School of Economics and Management, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China.); Zhang, Shengnan (School of Economics and Management, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China.); Zhu, Jiao (School of Economics and Management, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China.); Sun, Jiaojiao (School of Economics and Management, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China.)","Dong, Feng (China University of Mining and Technology)","Dong, Feng (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhang, Shengnan (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhu, Jiao (China University of Mining and Technology); Sun, Jiaojiao (China University of Mining and Technology)",4,4,,3.41,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/17/8946/pdf?version=1630047257,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140688491,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The major concern is the stochastic volatility of weather conditions that hinder the development of wind power forecasting approaches. To address this issue, the current study proposes a weather prediction method divided into two models for wind speed and atmospheric system forecasting. First, the data-based model incorporated with wavelet transform and recurrent neural networks is employed to predict the wind speed. Second, the physics-informed echo state network was used to learn the chaotic behavior of the atmospheric system. The findings were validated with a case study conducted on wind speed data from Turkmenistan.

Molecular imaging refers to the ability of various methods to in vivo characterize and quantify biological processes, at a molecular level. The extracted information provides the tools to understand the pathophysiology of diseases and thus to early detect, to accurately evaluate the extend and to apply and evaluate targeted treatments. At present, molecular imaging mainly involves CT, MRI, radionuclide, US, and optical imaging and has been reported in many clinical and preclinical studies. Although originally MI techniques targeted at central nervous system disorders, later on their value on musculoskeletal disorders was also studied in depth. Meaningful exploitation of the large volume of imaging data generated by molecular and conventional imaging techniques, requires state-of-the-art computational methods that enable rapid handling of large volumes of information. AI allows end-to-end training of computer algorithms to perform tasks encountered in everyday clinical practice including diagnosis, disease severity classification and image optimization. Notably, the development of deep learning algorithms has offered novel methods that enable intelligent processing of large imaging datasets in an attempt to automate decision-making in a wide variety of settings related to musculoskeletal trauma. Current applications of AI include the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue injuries, monitoring of the healing process and prediction of injuries in the professional sports setting. This review presents the current applications of novel MI techniques and methods and the emerging role of AI regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of musculoskeletal trauma.","The authors would like to thank Drs.

7582,pub.1145947542,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118241,35259557,,Water clarity mapping of global lakes using a novel hybrid deep-learning-based recurrent model with Landsat OLI images,"Information regarding water clarity at large spatiotemporal scales is critical for understanding comprehensive changes in the water quality and status of ecosystems. Previous studies have suggested that satellite observation is an effective means of obtaining such information. However, a reliable model for accurately mapping the water clarity of global lakes (reservoirs) is still lacking due to the high optical complexity of lake waters. In this study, by using gated recurrent units (GRU) layers instead of full-connected layers from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to capture the efficient sequence information of in-situ datasets, we propose a novel and transferrable hybrid deep-learning-based recurrent model (DGRN) to map the water clarity of global lakes with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. We trained and further validated the model using 1260 pairs of in-situ measured water clarity and surface reflectance of Landsat 8 OLI images with Google Earth Engine. The model was subsequently utilized to construct the global pattern of temporal and spatial changes in water clarity (lake area>10 km2) from 2014 to 2020. The results show that the model can estimate water clarity with good performance (R2 = 0.84, MAE = 0.55, RMSE = 0.83, MAPE = 45.13%). The multi-year average of water clarity for global lakes (16,475 lakes) ranged from 0.0004 to 9.51 m, with an average value of 1.88 ± 1.24 m. Compared to the lake area, elevation, discharge, residence time, and the ratio of area to depth, water depth was the most important factor that determined the global spatial distribution pattern of water clarity. Water clarity of 15,840 global lakes between 2014 and 2020 remained stable (P ≥ 0.05); while there was a significant increase in 243 lakes (P < 0.05) and a decrease in 392 lakes (P < 0.05). However, water clarity in 2020 (COVID-19 period) showed a significant increase in most global lakes, especially in China and Canada, suggesting that the worldwide lockdown strategy due to COVID-19 might have improved water quality, espically water clarity, dueto the apparent reduction of anthropogenic activities.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41922005 and 41930760), Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) (GML2019ZD0601), Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program, (2019QZKK0202), Scientific Instrument Developing Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (YJKYYQ20200071), Youth Innovation Promotion Association (CAS) (Y2021085), and NIGLAS foundation (E1SL002).

The algorithm is inspired by the foraging behavior of polycephalus slime moulds. It simulates the behavior and morphological changes of slime moulds during foraging through adaptive weights. Although the original SMA's performance is better than most swarm intelligence algorithms, it still has shortcomings, such as quickly falling into local optimal values and insufficient exploitation. This paper proposes a Gaussian barebone mutation enhanced SMA (GBSMA) to alleviate the original SMA’s shortcomings. First of all, the Gaussian function in the Gaussian barebone accelerates the convergence while also expanding the search space, which improves the algorithm exploration and exploitation capabilities. Secondly, the differential evolution (DE) update strategy in the Gaussian barebone, using rand\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Also, the greedy selection is introduced on this basis, which prevents individuals from performing invalid position updates.

Experimental results show that the convergence speed and solution accuracy of the proposed GBSMA are significantly better than the original SMA and other similar products.","This research is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LZ22F020005), National Natural Science Foundation of China (62076185, U1809209) and Zhejiang Xinmiao Talents Program (2021R429051), Wenzhou Science &amp; Technology Bureau (ZG2020030), Humanities and Social Science Research Planning Fund Project of the Ministry of Education (20YJA790090).

We then summarize four major types of applications of ML in ESE: making predictions; extracting feature importance; detecting anomalies; and discovering new materials or chemicals. Next, we introduce the essential knowledge required and current shortcomings in ML applications in ESE, with a focus on three important but often overlooked components when applying ML: correct model development, proper model interpretation, and sound applicability analysis.

The recurrent matrix multiplication is replaced with an efficient cyclic shift operation. The proposed intESN approach is verified with typical tasks in reservoir computing: memorizing of a sequence of inputs, classifying time series, and learning dynamic processes.

However, the complexity and interconnectivity of the farmland ecosystem restricts the improvement of the prediction accuracy of traditional methods. This research explored the application potential of graph neural network (GNN) technology, which can extract and learn information in large-scale networks in detail, in the field of heavy metal prediction for the first time. In this study, a heavy metal prediction model for rice, CoNet-GNN, was proposed with 17 environmental factors as input variables using the co-occurrence network and GNN. Experimental results using a dataset from a field study showed that the R2 of CoNet-GNN for predicting Cd, Pb, Cr, As, and Hg had outstanding values of 0.872, 0.711, 0.683, 0.489, and 0.824, respectively. Sensitivity analysis further indicated that CoNet-GNN had good stability and robustness. Compared with random forest, gradient boosting, and multilayer perceptron, CoNet-GNN made a remarkable improvement to the prediction accuracy of all studied heavy metals. Therefore, CoNet-GNN can effectively simulate the rich relationships and laws between various factors in the soil-rice system and effectively characterize the influence diffusion path. Furthermore, it provides new ideas for heavy metal prediction based on network research methods and expands the technical scope of heavy metal evaluation.","Part of this study was supported by National Agricultural Product Quality and Safety Risk Assessment Project, China (GJFP201701201).

Precipitation (PP) prediction is an interesting topic in the meteorology or hydrology field since it is directly related to agriculture, the management of water resources in hydrologic basins, and water scarcity. Selecting the right model to predict precipitation has always been a challenge because it could help researchers to use the proper model for their purposes. Accordingly, the performance of five artificial models (feed-forward neural network, cascade forward neural network, Elman neural network, multi-layer perceptron neural network, and radial basis neural network) and three mathematical models (Poisson regression model (PRM), quadratic model, and multiple linear regression) were evaluated for their ability to predict the monthly precipitation in Mediterranean coastal cities located in Eastern part of Mediterranean Sea for the first time. Twenty-seven Mediterranean coastal cities are considered case studies. For this aim, scenario 1 and scenario 2 with various input variables are proposed. Scenario 1 is developed using the number of months (MN), maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), downward radiation (DR), wind speed (WS), vapor pressure (VP), and actual evapotranspiration (AE). Scenario 2 is developed by adding geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude) to the global meteorological data to see the impact of geographical coordinates on the accuracy of the prediction of monthly precipitation. This study utilized the monthly data, which were obtained from TerraClimate for the period from 2010 to 2021. Based on the performance indexes, the PRM model performed best for the prediction of monthly precipitation in all selected locations compared to other models. Moreover, the results indicate that scenario 2 (PP=fTmax,Tmin,DR,WS,VP,AE,MN,Lat,Long,Alt\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The major challenge is to establish cooperation among intelligent virtual agents for solving the situations of social dilemmas. In humans, personality and emotions are the primary factors that lead them toward a cooperative environment. To make agents cooperate, they have to become more like humans, that is, believable. Therefore, we hypothesize that emotions according to the personality give birth to believability, and if believability is introduced into agents through emotions, it improves their survival rate in social dilemma situations. The existing researches have introduced different computational models to introduce emotions in virtual agents, but they lack emotions through neurotransmitters. We have proposed a neurotransmitters-based deep Q-learning computational model in multiagents that is a suitable choice for emotion modeling and, hence, believability. The proposed model regulates the agents' emotions by controlling the virtual neurotransmitters (dopamine and oxytocin) according to the agent's personality. The personality of the agent is introduced using OCEAN model. To evaluate the proposed system, we simulated a survival scenario with limited food resources in different experiments. These experiments vary the number of selfish agents (higher neuroticism personality trait) and the selfless agents (higher agreeableness personality trait). Experimental results show that by adding the selfless agents in the scenario, the agents develop cooperation, and their collective survival time increases. Thus, to resolve the social dilemma problems in virtual agents, we can make agents believable through the proposed neurotransmitter-based emotional model. This proposed work may help in developing nonplayer characters (NPCs) in games.","The authors wish to thank Hina Parveen, Mamona Zahoor, UmeHabiba Saleem, and Zuhha Azhar, the Bs final-year students of Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore for their dedication and hard work.

Reducing runoff is an essential management tool to protect water and soil resources. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vegetation and land management methods on runoff control and to provide a model to predict runoff values. Filed plot data and three machine learning (ML) methods, including artificial neural network (ANN), coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS), and extreme gradient boosting (EGB), were used in a test site in the north of Iran. In this regard, plots with various vegetation and land management treatments including bare soil treatment, rangeland cover treatment, forest litter treatment, rangeland litter treatment, tillage treatment in the direction of slope, tillage treatment perpendicular to the slope, and repetition of treatments under forest canopy were constructed on a hillslope. After each rainfall event, the amount of rainfall and corresponding runoff generated in each plot was recorded. Three ML models (ANN, CANFIS, and EGB) were used to establish relationships between amounts of recorded runoff and its controlling factors (rainfall, antecedent soil moisture (A.M.C), shrub canopy percentage and height, tree canopy percentage and height, soil texture (clay, silt, and sand percent), slope degree, leaf litter percentage of soil, and tillage interval). These data were normalized, randomized, and divided into training and testing subsets. Results showed that the ANN performed better than the other two models in predicting runoff in training (R2 = 0.98; MSE = 0.004) and the test stages (R2 = 0.90; MSE = 0.95). Statistical analysis and sensitivity analysis of inputs factors showed that rainfall, rangeland cover, and A.M.C are the three most important factors controlling runoff generation. The adopted method can be used to predict the effect of different vegetation and land management scenarios on runoff generation in the study area and the areas with similar settings elsewhere.",We would like to thank the University of Guilan for providing the space and facilities for this study.,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Humans; Conservation of Natural Resources; Rain; Water Movements; Soil; Water,2022-11-29,2022,2022-11-29,2023-03,30,11,31202-31217,All OA; Green,Article,"Gholami, Vahid; Sahour, Hossein; Khaleghi, Mohammad Reza; Yousefi, Atena","Gholami, Vahid (Department of Range and Watershed Management and Dept. of Water Eng. and Environment, Faculty of Natural Resources, University of Guilan, 1144, Sowmeh Sara, Guilan, Iran); Sahour, Hossein (Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences, Western Michigan University, 49008, Kalamazoo, MI, USA); Khaleghi, Mohammad Reza (Torbat-E-Jam Branch, Islamic Azad University, Torbat-E-Jam, Iran); Yousefi, Atena (Department of Range and Watershed Management, Faculty of Natural Resources, University of Guilan, 1144, Sowmeh Sara, Guilan, Iran)","Gholami, Vahid (University of Guilan)","Gholami, Vahid (University of Guilan); Sahour, Hossein (Western Michigan University); Khaleghi, Mohammad Reza (Islamic Azad University, Tehran); Yousefi, Atena (University of Guilan)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1989800/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153204915,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences",15 Life on Land

LSM is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs); CNNs use fixed convolutional kernels, focus more on local information and do not retain spatial information. This is a property of the CNN itself, resulting in low accuracy of LSM. Based on the above problems, we use Vision Transformer (ViT) and its derivative model Swin Transformer (Swin) to conduct LSM for the selected study area. Machine learning and a CNN model are used for comparison. Fourier transform amplitude, feature similarity and other indicators were used to compare and analyze the difference in the results. The results show that the Swin model has the best accuracy, F1-score and AUC. The results of LSM are combined with landslide points, faults and other data analysis; the ViT model results are the most consistent with the actual situation, showing the strongest generalization ability. In this paper, we believe that the advantages of ViT and its derived models in global feature extraction ensure that ViT is more accurate than CNN and machine learning in predicting landslide probability in the study area.",,This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No.2019YFC1509401).,Sensors,,"Electric Power Supplies; Neural Networks, Computer; Machine Learning; Algorithms; Data Analysis",2022-11-23,2022,2022-11-23,,22,23,9104,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bao, Shuai; Liu, Jiping; Wang, Liang; Zhao, Xizhi","Bao, Shuai (School of Geomatics, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China; Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping, Beijing 100036, China); Liu, Jiping (Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping, Beijing 100036, China); Wang, Liang (Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping, Beijing 100036, China); Zhao, Xizhi (Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping, Beijing 100036, China)","Wang, Liang (Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping)","Bao, Shuai (Liaoning Technical University; Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping); Liu, Jiping (Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping); Wang, Liang (Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping); Zhao, Xizhi (Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/23/9104/pdf?version=1669370097,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153115018,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,15 Life on Land

For this purpose, a spectroradiometer was utilized to collect hyperspectral data in the VIS-NIR-SWIR range, and 17 AIAs were applied to classify lettuce plants. The results showed that the highest accuracy and precision were achieved using the full hyperspectral curves or the specific spectral ranges of 400-700 nm, 700-1300 nm, and 1300-2400 nm. Four models, AdB, CN2, G-Boo, and NN, demonstrated exceptional R2 and ROC values, exceeding 0.99, when compared between all models and confirming the hypothesis and highlighting the potential of AIAs and hyperspectral fingerprints for efficient, precise classification and pigment phenotyping in agriculture. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of efficient methods for phenotyping and classification in agriculture and the potential of AIAs in combination with hyperspectral technology. To advance our understanding of the capabilities of hyperspectroscopy and AIs in precision agriculture and contribute to the development of more effective and sustainable agriculture practices, further research is needed to explore the full potential of these technologies in different crop species and environments.",Thanks to Cristiane Moriwaki de Andrade at the State University of Maringá for supporting pigment profiling and Érika Cristina Takamizawa Sato for managing funds in PGA-UEM.

Here we design an artificial neural network of coupled phase oscillators and, by the technique of reservoir computing in machine learning, train it for predicting chaos. It is found that when the machine is properly trained, oscillators in the reservoir are synchronized into clusters whose sizes follow a power-law distribution. This feature, however, is absent when the machine is poorly trained. Additionally, it is found that despite the synchronization degree of the original network, once properly trained, the reservoir network is always developed to the same critical state, exemplifying the ""attractor"" nature of this state in machine learning. The generality of the results is verified in different reservoir models and by different target systems, and it is found that the scaling exponent of the distribution is independent of the reservoir details and the bifurcation parameters of the target system, but is modified when the dynamics of the target system is changed to a different type. The findings shed light on the nature of machine learning, and are helpful to the design of high-performance machines in physical systems.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) under Grants No. 11875182, No. 11775034, and No. 11775035.",,Physical Review E,,,2022-05-03,2022,2022-05-03,2022-05,105,5,l052201,All OA; Green,Article,"Wang, Liang; Fan, Huawei; Xiao, Jinghua; Lan, Yueheng; Wang, Xingang","Wang, Liang (School of Physics and Information Technology, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710062, China.); Fan, Huawei (School of Physics and Information Technology, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710062, China.); Xiao, Jinghua (School of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China.); Lan, Yueheng (School of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China.); Wang, Xingang (School of Physics and Information Technology, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710062, China.)",,"Wang, Liang (Shaanxi Normal University); Fan, Huawei (Shaanxi Normal University); Xiao, Jinghua (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Lan, Yueheng (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Wang, Xingang (Shaanxi Normal University)",2,2,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06395,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147572788,51 Physical Sciences,

These machine learning models, which use dense genome-wide markers to predict phenotype, routinely perform well on single-environment datasets, especially for complex traits affected by multiple markers. On the other hand, machine learning models for predicting crop phenotype, especially deep learning models, using datasets that span different environmental conditions, have only recently emerged. Models that can accept heterogeneous data sources, such as temperature, soil conditions and precipitation, are natural choices for modeling GxE in multi-environment prediction.

Exploring the relationships between drivers and water quality parameters at the regional scale is key in the identification of appropriate actions for the reduction of water pollution. Regional models are the appropriate tool to achieve this, though their development poses relevant challenges because of the complexity and non-linearity of such relationships. Among the available approaches, Machine Learning (ML) is promising because of its capability to detect complex nonlinear relationships and flexibility in the parameterization, which is learned from data. In this work, we developed regional models of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, arsenic, sulfate and chloride concentrations, as well as electrical conductivity, by using two ML algorithms, Random Forest and Deep feed-forward Neural Network, and compared their performances against the standard Linear Regression model. Our results indicate that the two ML algorithms are much more accurate models for such variables than the classical Linear Regression model, with Deep feed-forward Neural Network being the most effective in identifying the reciprocal importance of the drivers and capturing nonlinear relationships between drivers and water quality variables. Our analysis also revealed that the Julian day and year at which the sample was taken surrogate the air temperature in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen, with only a slight performance reduction. Arsenic, sulfate, and chloride show more complex behaviors in which geogenic and anthropogenic sources are intertwined. Dilution exerts a role chiefly for arsenic concentration, which suggests a non-uniform, in space, geogenic origin for this variable.","This research was partially supported by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) under the Departments of Excellence, grant L.232/2016.

In recent years, there has also been an increase in the volume of research into the application of AI to air pollution. This study aims to explore the latest trends in the application of AI in the field of air pollution.
Methods: All literature on the application of AI to air pollution was searched from the Web of Science database. CiteSpace 5.8.R1 was used to analyze countries/regions, institutions, authors, keywords and references cited, and to reveal hot spots and frontiers of AI in atmospheric pollution.
Results: Beginning in 1994, publications on AI in air pollution have increased in number, with a surge in research since 2017. The leading country and institution were China (N = 524) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (N = 58), followed by the United States (N = 455) and Tsinghua University (N = 33), respectively. In addition, the United States (0.24) and the England (0.27) showed a high degree of centrality. Most of the identified articles were published in journals related to environmental science; the most cited journal was Atmospheric Environment, which reached nearly 1,000 citations. There were few collaborations among authors, institutions and countries. The hot topics were machine learning, air pollution and deep learning. The majority of the researchers concentrated on air pollutant concentration prediction, particularly the combined use of AI and environmental science methods, low-cost air quality sensors, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort.
Conclusion: Researches in the field of AI and air pollution are expanding rapidly in recent years. The majority of scholars are from China and the United States, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the dominant research institution. The United States and the England contribute greatly to the development of the cooperation network. Cooperation among research institutions appears to be suboptimal, and strengthening cooperation could greatly benefit this field of research. The prediction of air pollutant concentrations, particularly PM2.5, low-cost air quality sensors, and thermal comfort are the current research hotspot.","We thank Susan L.

However, it is the performance of the hardware, in particular the energy efficiency of a computing system that sets the fundamental limit of the capability of machine learning. Data-centric computing requires a revolution in hardware systems, since traditional digital computers based on transistors and the von Neumann architecture were not purposely designed for neuromorphic computing. A hardware platform based on emerging devices and new architecture is the hope for future computing with dramatically improved throughput and energy efficiency. Building such a system, nevertheless, faces a number of challenges, ranging from materials selection, device optimization, circuit fabrication and system integration, to name a few.

In this paper, a novel method, termed lower upper bound estimation (LUBE), of constructing prediction intervals (PIs) based on neural networks (NNs) is applied and extended to landslide displacement prediction. A random vector functional link network (RVFLN) is adopted as the NN used in the improved LUBE. A hybrid evolutionary algorithm, termed PSOGSA, that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is utilized to train LUBE. The loss function of LUBE is redesigned by considering the quality of PI centre, which allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of PIs. The population initialization in the training process of LUBE is implemented by transferring the weights of a series of pre-trained RVFLNs. The performance of the improved LUBE method is validated by considering a comprehensive set of cases using seven benchmark datasets. In addition, a hybrid method that integrates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with the improved LUBE is proposed for the special case of landslide displacement prediction. Six real-world reservoir-induced landslides are considered to validate the capability and merit of the proposed hybrid method.","The work was supported by the National Key RD Program of China under Grant 2017YFC1501301, the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61876219, 61503144, 61976226, 61761130081 and 61821003, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WUT: 2020III044), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, South-Central University for Nationalities (CZT20021).",,Neural Networks,,"Algorithms; Forecasting; Neural Networks, Computer; Support Vector Machine",2020-07-18,2020,2020-07-18,2020-10,130,,286-296,Closed,Article,"Lian, Cheng; Zeng, Zhigang; Wang, Xiaoping; Yao, Wei; Su, Yixin; Tang, Huiming","Lian, Cheng (School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.

An Urban Scholar’s Perspective","In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has started to manifest itself at an unprecedented pace. With highly sophisticated capabilities, AI has the potential to dramatically change our cities and societies. Despite its growing importance, the urban and social implications of AI are still an understudied area. In order to contribute to the ongoing efforts to address this research gap, this paper introduces the notion of an artificially intelligent city as the potential successor of the popular smart city brand-where the smartness of a city has come to be strongly associated with the use of viable technological solutions, including AI. The study explores whether building artificially intelligent cities can safeguard humanity from natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophes. All of the statements in this viewpoint are based on a thorough review of the current status of AI literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. This paper generates insights and identifies prospective research questions by charting the evolution of AI and the potential impacts of the systematic adoption of AI in cities and societies. The generated insights inform urban policymakers, managers, and planners on how to ensure the correct uptake of AI in our cities, and the identified critical questions offer scholars directions for prospective research and development.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

In this study, we proposed a real-time measurement method for total nitrogen (TN) by combining the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of intelligent algorithms, based on the physical and chemical relationships between TN and sensor-measured indexes. Extra tree regression was selected as the TN inversion algorithm, which has high precision, high computational efficiency, and better ability in over-fitting control. The results show that: (1) the real-time inversion algorithm of TN can achieve the monitoring frequency at the minute scale (<5 min); (2) the method performs well (R2>0.9) when the training and testing datasets are from similar environmental backgrounds (fields or ditches); (3) in the case of partial variable missing, this method can still realize TN inversion, and the prediction accuracy is acceptable (R2>0.7) under the number of missing variables (n) ≤ 2, which makes up for the flaws of missing or abnormal data caused by sensor malfunctions. Overall, the proposed real-time measurement method of TN has stable data acquisition, high precision, and high monitoring frequency. In addition, the method is not limited by cloudy, rainy, or nighttime conditions. Compared with methods such as laboratory test, remote sensing inversion, and water quality automatic monitoring station, our method has obvious advantages in runoff monitoring of NPS pollution, which mainly occurs in small and micro water bodies. The new real-time measurement of TN for runoff may provide important technological support for pre-warning and emergency control of NPS pollution.",This work was supported by the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 2021CFA083); the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number XDA23040403); the Hubei Technological Innovation Special Fund of China (grant number 2018ACA148); and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number 2018370).,,Water Research,,"Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2021-12-21,2021,2021-12-21,2022-02,210,,117992,Closed,Article,"Zhuang, Yanhua; Wen, Weijia; Ruan, Shuhe; Zhuang, Fuzhen; Xia, Biqing; Li, Sisi; Liu, Hongbin; Du, Yun; Zhang, Liang","Zhuang, Yanhua (Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center of Non-Point Source Pollution Control, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430077, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Wen, Weijia (Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center of Non-Point Source Pollution Control, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430077, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Ruan, Shuhe (Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center of Non-Point Source Pollution Control, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430077, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Zhuang, Fuzhen (Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China; SKLSDE, School of Computer Science, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China.); Xia, Biqing (Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center of Non-Point Source Pollution Control, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430077, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Li, Sisi (Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center of Non-Point Source Pollution Control, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430077, China.); Liu, Hongbin (Key Laboratory of Nonpoint Source Pollution Control, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs/Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.); Du, Yun (Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center of Non-Point Source Pollution Control, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430077, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Zhang, Liang (Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center of Non-Point Source Pollution Control, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430077, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.

One of the best approaches to remove the experimental limitations is artificial intelligence (AI). This review discusses the role of AI in materials discovery and ISMs engineering. The AI can minimize the need for experimental tests by data analysis to accelerate computational methods based on models using the results of ISMs simulations. The coupling with computational chemistry makes it possible for the AI to consider atomic features in the output models since AI acts as a bridge between the experimental data and computational chemistry to develop models that can use experimental data and atomic properties. This hybrid method can be used in materials discovery of the membranes for ion extraction to investigate capabilities, challenges, and future perspectives of the AI-based materials discovery, which can pave the path for ISMs engineering.",The authors would like to show our appreciation to Mohammad Khedri and Keyvan Karimi for their contribution to the editing of this work.

This study provides a perspective of machine learning for controlling the operation of the drainage system and exploring whether the operation suggestions regarding facilities in this system can be given in real time while relying only on real-time data and avoiding the complex model simulation process. Herein, five drainage systems were used as examples: the initial water level of a pipeline, key point water level flow, pump station front pool water level, and most unfavorable point water level were selected as relevant variables and four machine-learning discrimination methods were used for to analyze the weir-lowering operation of a deep tunnel.

Several machine learning (ML) models have been developed for modeling HMs over the past two decades with outstanding progress. Although there have been a noticeable number of diverse ML models investigations, it is essential to have an informative vision on the progression of those computer aid models. In the current short review covering the simulation of heavy metals in contaminated soil, water bodies and removal from aqueous solution, numerous aspects on the methodological and conceptual HMs modeling are reviewed and discussed in detail. For instance, the limitation of the classical analytical methods, types of heavy metal dataset, necessity for new versions of ML models exploration, HM input parameters selection, ML models internal parameters tuning, performance metrics selection and the types of the modelled HM. The current review provides few outlooks in understanding the underlying od the ML models application for HM simulation. Tackling these modeling aspects is significantly essential for ML developers and environmental scientists to obtain creditability and scientific consistency in the domain of environmental science. Based on the discussed modeling aspects, it was concluded several future research directions, which will promote environmental scientists for better understanding of the underlying HMs simulation.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Chemosphere,,"Adsorption; Machine Learning; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Water",2021-03-18,2021,2021-03-18,2021-08,277,,130126,Closed,Article,"Yaseen, Zaher Mundher","Yaseen, Zaher Mundher (New era and development in civil engineering research group, Scientific Research Center, Al-Ayen University, Thi-Qar, 64001, Iraq.

Here, we appraise the roles of theory-based approaches focusing on the experiment-dominated wet-biology research areas of microbial growth and survival, cell physiology, host-pathogen interactions, and competitive or symbiotic interactions. Additional examples relate to analyses of genome-sequence data, climate change and planetary health, habitability, and astrobiology. We assess the importance of thought at each step of the research process; the roles of natural philosophy, and inconsistencies in logic and language, as drivers of scientific progress; the value of thought experiments; the use and limitations of artificial intelligence technologies, including their potential for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research; and other instances when theory is the most-direct and most-scientifically robust route to scientific novelty including the development of techniques for practical experimentation or fieldwork. We highlight the intrinsic need for human engagement in scientific innovation, an issue pertinent to the ongoing controversy over papers authored using/authored by artificial intelligence (such as the large language model/chatbot ChatGPT). Other issues discussed are the way in which aspects of language can bias thinking towards the spatial rather than the temporal (and how this biased thinking can lead to skewed scientific terminology); receptivity to research that is non-mainstream; and the importance of theory-based science in education and epistemology. Whereas we briefly highlight classic works (those by Oakes Ames, Francis H.C. Crick and James D. Watson, Charles R. Darwin, Albert Einstein, James E. Lovelock, Lynn Margulis, Gilbert Ryle, Erwin R.J.A. Schrödinger, Alan M. Turing, and others), the focus is on microbiology studies that are more-recent, discussing these in the context of the scientific process and the types of scientific novelty that they represent. These include several studies carried out during the 2020 to 2022 lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic when access to research laboratories was disallowed (or limited). We interviewed the authors of some of the featured microbiology-related papers and-although we ourselves are involved in laboratory experiments and practical fieldwork-also drew from our own research experiences showing that such studies can not only produce new scientific findings but can also transcend barriers between disciplines, act counter to scientific reductionism, integrate biological data across different timescales and levels of complexity, and circumvent constraints imposed by practical techniques. In relation to urgent research needs, we believe that climate change and other global challenges may require approaches beyond the experiment.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful for helpful discussions with Akshay Audhkhasi (ONGC Videsh Limited, New Delhi, India), Philip Ball (London, England, UK), Samiran Banerjee (North Dakota State University, ND, USA), Bonnie K.

This study shows that nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural networks can provide accurate models to predict nitrate plus nitrite concentrations in waterways. The Susquehanna River and the Raccoon River, USA, were chosen as case studies. Water discharge, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and specific conductance were considered exogenous inputs. The forecasting sensitivity to changes in the exogenous input parameters and time series length was also assessed. For Kreutz Creek at Strickler station (Pennsylvania), the prediction accuracy increased with the number of exogenous input variables, with the best performance achieved considering all the variables (R2 = 0.77). The predictions were accurate also for the Raccoon River (Iowa), although only the water discharge was considered exogenous input (South Raccoon River at Redfield—R2 = 0.94).

The flow characteristics of gas and water are very complicated and important in the process of CBM exploitation. In recent years, machine learning has been introduced to analyze CBM well production and its influence based on the historical production data. However, there are some problems with the determination of hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms. Some previous random forests (RF) models of CBM production prediction were suitable for individual CBM wells, but for different types of CBM wells, a large amount of time is needed to adjust the hyperparameters. Therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to optimize RF, and a hybrid GA-RF algorithm was presented to solve this problem, which can automatically adjust two important hyperparameters, n tree and m try, and adapt different types of CBM wells. Meanwhile, the Pearson method and RF were carried out in this work to analyze the data of CBM well production to avoid multicollinearity caused by the improper selection of the model's independent variables. The importance and correlation analysis of drainage control parameters, including casing pressure (P c), bottom-hole pressure (P b), stroke frequency (f s), liquid column depth (D L), daily decline of bottom-hole pressure (P bd), and daily decline of casing pressure (P cd) were obtained. It was found that the casing pressure, bottom-hole pressure, and stroke frequency had more effects on the gas production of CBM wells than other drainage control parameters. Furthermore, the correlation and importance order of the influencing factors were: P c > P b > f s > P bd > P cd > D L and P c > P b > f s > D L > P bd > P cd, respectively. A CBM production model based on the GA-RF algorithm was constructed to study and predict the gas production of CBM wells in Qinshui Basin, China. Compared with the production model based on RF, this model can automatically optimize its hyperparameters to adapt to different types of CBM wells, and the mean-square-error of the GA-RF algorithm can be reduced by 40-60% than that of RF. 93% of the training errors were less than 5%, and 89% of the prediction errors were less than 10%. The GA-RF model can spot promptly the main influencing factors of CBM production and has high accuracy for the production prediction of CBM wells.",This research was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (52074297) and the Central University Basic Research Fund of China (2021YJSLJ02).,,ACS Omega,,,2022-04-07,2022,2022-04-07,2022-04-19,7,15,13083-13094,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhu, Jie; Zhao, Yuhan; Hu, Qiujia; Zhang, Yang; Shao, Tangsha; Fan, Bin; Jiang, Yaodong; Chen, Zhen; Zhao, Meng","Zhu, Jie (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing Campus, Beijing, 100083, China); Zhao, Yuhan (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing Campus, Beijing, 100083, China); Hu, Qiujia (PetroChina Huabei Oilfield Co, Renqiu, 062550, China); Zhang, Yang (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing Campus, Beijing, 100083, China); Shao, Tangsha (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing Campus, Beijing, 100083, China); Fan, Bin (PetroChina Huabei Oilfield Co, Renqiu, 062550, China); Jiang, Yaodong (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing Campus, Beijing, 100083, China); Chen, Zhen (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing Campus, Beijing, 100083, China); Zhao, Meng (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing Campus, Beijing, 100083, China)","Zhu, Jie (China University of Mining and Technology)","Zhu, Jie (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhao, Yuhan (China University of Mining and Technology); Hu, Qiujia (); Zhang, Yang (China University of Mining and Technology); Shao, Tangsha (China University of Mining and Technology); Fan, Bin (); Jiang, Yaodong (China University of Mining and Technology); Chen, Zhen (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhao, Meng (China University of Mining and Technology)",8,8,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00519,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146952051,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

However, reservoir parameters are usually expensive and time-consuming to obtain through petrophysical experiments of core samples, which makes a fast and reliable prediction method highly demanded. In this article, we propose a deep learning model that combines the 1-D convolutional layer and the bidirectional long short-term memory network to predict reservoir permeability and porosity. The mapping relationship between logging data and reservoir parameters is established by training a network with a combination of nonlinear and linear modules. Optimization algorithms, such as layer normalization, recurrent dropout, and early stopping, can help obtain a more accurate training model. Besides, the self-attention mechanism enables the network to better allocate weights to improve the prediction accuracy. The testing results of the well-trained network in blind wells of three different regions show that our proposed method is accurate and robust in the reservoir parameters prediction task.",,,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,,2022-03-21,2022,2022-03-21,2022-03-21,PP,99,1-15,Closed,Article,"Yang, Liuqing; Wang, Shoudong; Chen, Xiaohong; Chen, Wei; Saad, Omar M.; Zhou, Xu; Pham, Nam; Geng, Zhicheng; Fomel, Sergey; Chen, Yangkang","Yang, Liuqing (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting and the National Engineering Laboratory of Offshore Oil Exploration, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing 102249, China.); Wang, Shoudong (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting and the National Engineering Laboratory of Offshore Oil Exploration, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing 102249, China.); Chen, Xiaohong (State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting and the National Engineering Laboratory of Offshore Oil Exploration, China University of Petroleum (Beijing), Beijing 102249, China.); Chen, Wei (Hubei Cooperative Innovation Center of Unconventional Oil and Gas, Yangtze University, Wuhan 430100, China.); Saad, Omar M.

Predicting wheat yield is a real challenge for better agriculture and food security management. Modeling wheat yield is complex and challenging, so robust tools are needed. The main aim of this study is to predict wheat yield using an advanced ensemble model. A multilayer perceptron model (MLP) was combined with optimization algorithms to determine MLP parameters as the first step in the study. Several optimization algorithms were used as optimizers, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Honey Badger Algorithms (HBA), Sine–Cosine Algorithms (SCA), and Shark Algorithms (SA). Meteorological data were inserted into models. Next, the outputs of optimized MLP models were incorporated into an inclusive multiple MLP model (IMM). A new hybrid gamma test was used to determine the most appropriate input combination. A hybrid gamma test was created by coupling the HBA with GT. This paper introduces a robust IMM model, develops an MLP model using optimization algorithms, develops a new hybrid gamma test, uses Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to analyze uncertainty, and presents a spatial map of wheat yield prediction. Based on the Gamma Test analysis, mean air temperature (Ta), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), evapotranspiration (ET), and precipitation (P) were the most important input parameters for reliable and accurate winter wheat yield predictions. At the testing level, the IMM model decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of the MLP-HBA, MLP-SCA, MLP-SA, MLP-PSO, and MLP models by 47%, 52%, 55%, 58%, and 61%, respectively. In the study, the uncertainty of models based on input data was significantly lower than that of the model parameters. In addition, the GLUE analysis revealed that the wheat yield predictions were more stable and confident by considering the ensemble IMM technique. The pattern of root mean square error (RMSE) maps demonstrated that higher error produces in the northeast of Urmia Lake. The developed framework provides insight into rainfed yield responses to weather conditions and is simple and inexpensive. Accurate and reliable wheat yield prediction is essential for agricultural monitoring and food policy analysis.",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,"Triticum; Uncertainty; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms; Spatial Analysis",2022-10-20,2022,2022-10-20,2023-02,30,8,20887-20906,Closed,Article,"Soroush, Fatemeh; Ehteram, Mohammad; Seifi, Akram","Soroush, Fatemeh (Department of Water Science & Engineering, College of Agriculture, Vali-E-Asr University of Rafsanjan, P.O.

In the Brazilian semi-arid, eutrophication in reservoirs raises the risk of water scarcity. The reservoirs have also a high seasonal and annual variability of water level and volume, which can have important effects on chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla). Assessing the influence of climate and hydrological variability on phytoplankton growth can be important to find strategies to achieve water security in tropical regions with similar problems. This study explores the potential of machine learning models to predict Chla in reservoirs and to understand their relationship with hydrological and climate variables. The model is based mainly on satellite data, which makes the methodology useful for data-scarce regions. Tree-based ensemble methods had the best performances among six machine learning methods and one parametric model. This performance can be considered satisfactory as classical empirical relationships between Chla and phosphorus may not hold for tropical reservoirs. Water volume and the mix-layer depth are inversely related to Chla, while mean surface temperature, water level, and surface solar radiation have direct relationships with Chla. These findings provide insights on how seasonal climate prediction and reservoir operation might influence water quality in regions supplied by superficial reservoirs.",,The present study was supported through by the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (88887.123932/2015–00 and 88882.344015/2019–01); the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (441457/2017–7); and the Cearense Foundation for Scientific and Technological Support (Cientista-chefe program).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,China; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Lakes; Machine Learning; Phosphorus,2022-06-01,2022,2022-06-01,2022-10,29,49,74967-74982,Closed,Article,"Nunes Carvalho, Taís Maria; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo; Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis","Nunes Carvalho, Taís Maria (Department of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, Universidade Federal Do Ceará, Campus do Pici, Bloco 713, 60455-760, Fortaleza, CEP, Brazil); Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo (Department of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, Universidade Federal Do Ceará, Campus do Pici, Bloco 713, 60455-760, Fortaleza, CEP, Brazil); Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis (Department of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, Universidade Federal Do Ceará, Campus do Pici, Bloco 713, 60455-760, Fortaleza, CEP, Brazil)","Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo (Universidade Federal do Ceará)","Nunes Carvalho, Taís Maria (Universidade Federal do Ceará); Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo (Universidade Federal do Ceará); Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis (Universidade Federal do Ceará)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148350076,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 3707 Hydrology,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

These factors are threatening the environmental and economic sustainability of current and future food supply systems. Scientific and technological innovations are needed more than ever to secure enough food for a fast-growing global population. Scientific advances have led to a better understanding of how various components of the agricultural system interact, from the cell to the field level. Despite incredible advances in genetic tools over the past few decades, our ability to accurately assess crop status in the field, at scale, has been severely lacking until recently. Thanks to recent advances in remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can now quantify field scale phenotypic information accurately and integrate the big data into predictive and prescriptive management tools.

Therefore, the present research’s core objective is to create accurate and reliable machine learning models for irrigation parameters. To accomplish this determination, three machine learning (ML) models, viz. long short-term memory (LSTM), multi-linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN), have been trained. It is validated with mean squared error (MSE) and correlation coefficients (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These machine learning models have been used and applied for predicating the six irrigation water quality parameters such as sodium absorption ratio (SAR), percentage of sodium (%Na), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MH), Permeability Index (PI), and Kelly ratio (KR). Therefore, the two scenario performances of ANN, LSTM, and MLR have been developed for each model to predict irrigation water quality parameters. The first and second scenario performance was created based on all and second reduction input variables. The ANN, LSTM, and MLR models have discovered that excluding for ANN and MLR models shows high accuracy in first and second scenario models, respectively. These model’s accuracy was checked based on the mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficients (r), and root mean square error (RMSE) for training and testing processes serially. The RSC values are highly accurate predicated values using ANN and MLR models. As a result, machine learning models may improve irrigation water quality parameters, and such types of results are essential to farmers and crop planning in various irrigation processes.",The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,"Groundwater; Linear Models; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Quality",2021-11-08,2021,2021-11-08,2022-03,29,14,21067-21091,Closed,Article,"Kouadri, Saber; Pande, Chaitanya B.; Panneerselvam, Balamurugan; Moharir, Kanak N.; Elbeltagi, Ahmed","Kouadri, Saber (Laboratory of Water and Environment Engineering in Sahara Milieu (GEEMS), Department of Civil Engineering and Hydraulics Faculty of Applied Sciences, Kasdi Merbah University Ouargla, Ouargla, Algeria); Pande, Chaitanya B.

In particular, reservoir computing (RC) arises as an optimal computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data analysis. The direct on-silicon implementation of RCs may help to minimize power and maximize processing speed, that is especially relevant in edge intelligence applications where energy storage is considerably restricted. Nevertheless, most of the RC hardware solutions present in the literature perform the training process off-chip at the server level, thus increasing processing time and overall power dissipation. Some studies integrate both learning and inference on the same chip, although these works are normally oriented to implement unsupervised learning (UL) with a lower expected accuracy than supervised learning (SL), or propose iterative solutions (with a subsequent higher power consumption). Therefore, the integration of RC systems including both inference and a fast noniterative SL method is still an incipient field. In this article, we propose a noniterative SL methodology for RC systems that can be implemented on hardware either sequentially or fully parallel. The proposal presents a considerable advantage in terms of energy efficiency (EE) and processing speed if compared to traditional off-chip methods. In order to prove the validity of the model, a cyclic echo state NN with on-chip learning capabilities for time series prediction has been implemented and tested in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

It has undergone several reinforcements since it was put into service in the 1950s. In this study, the dam safety is evaluated by analyzing the measured displacements and simulating stresses in the concrete. Firstly, the multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) is used to train and test the relationships between the loads and displacement based on the hydrostatic-temperature-time (HTT) model. Subsequently, the contributions of water level, temperature, and time to displacements are determined, and the influence characteristics of water level and temperature on displacements are interpreted. Finally, the dam stress state is evaluated by establishing a dam finite element model and simulating the stress distribution in various operating conditions. The results indicate that (1) the dam is currently in an elastic state after the last reinforcement; (2) temperature contributes the most to the displacement, and the drastic fluctuation of temperature is the disadvantage factor for multi-arch dam safety; (3) the stresses generally can meet the requirements of code; and (4) the ideas and methods of the study can provide references for the safety evaluation of other concrete dams.","This research was substantially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U2243223, 51739003, 52079046), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (B210202017).",,Scientific Reports,,"Models, Theoretical; Research Design; Temperature; Water",2022-05-26,2022,2022-05-26,,12,1,8913,All OA; Gold,Article,"He, Qi; Gu, Chongshi; Valente, Silvio; Zhao, Erfeng; Liu, Xing; Yuan, Dongyang","He, Qi (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; College of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; National Engineering Research Center of Water Resources Efficient Utilization and Engineering Safety, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China); Gu, Chongshi (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; College of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; National Engineering Research Center of Water Resources Efficient Utilization and Engineering Safety, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China); Valente, Silvio (Department of Structural, Geotechnical and Building Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, 10129, Turin, Italy); Zhao, Erfeng (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; College of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; National Engineering Research Center of Water Resources Efficient Utilization and Engineering Safety, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China); Liu, Xing (China Three Gorges Construction Engineering Corporation, 610094, Chengdu, China); Yuan, Dongyang (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; College of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; National Engineering Research Center of Water Resources Efficient Utilization and Engineering Safety, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China)","He, Qi (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Hohai University; Hohai University)","He, Qi (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Hohai University; Hohai University); Gu, Chongshi (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Hohai University; Hohai University); Valente, Silvio (Polytechnic University of Turin); Zhao, Erfeng (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Hohai University; Hohai University); Liu, Xing (); Yuan, Dongyang (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Hohai University; Hohai University)",3,3,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13073-9.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148177431,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Microalgae-based wastewater treatment has resulted in a paradigm shift in our approach toward nutrient removal and simultaneous resource recovery from wastewater. Wastewater treatment and the generation of biofuels and bioproducts from microalgae can be coupled to promote the circular economy synergistically. A microalgal biorefinery transforms microalgal biomass into biofuels, bioactive chemicals, and biomaterials. The large-scale cultivation of microalgae is essential for the commercialization and industrialization of microalgae biorefinery. However, the inherent complexity of microalgal cultivation parameters regarding physiological and illumination parameters renders it challenging to facilitate a smooth and cost-effective operation. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning algorithms (MLA) offer innovative strategies for assessing, predicting, and regulating uncertainties in algal wastewater treatment and biorefinery. The current study presents a critical review of the most promising AI/MLAs that demonstrate a potential to be applied in microalgal technologies. The most commonly used MLAs include artificial neural networks, support vector machine, genetic algorithms, decision tree, and random forest algorithms. Recent developments in AI have made it possible to combine cutting-edge techniques from AI research fields with microalgae for accurate analysis of large datasets. MLAs have been extensively studied for their potential in microalgae detection and classification. However, the ML application in microalgal industries, such as optimizing microalgae cultivation for increased biomass productivity, is still in its infancy.

In the past decade, the unprecedented accumulation of data, the development of high-performance computing power, and the rise of diverse machine learning (ML) methods provide new opportunities for environmental pollution research. The ML methodology has been used in satellite data processing to obtain ground-level concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, pollution source apportionment, and spatial distribution modeling of water pollutants. However, unlike the active practices of ML in chemical toxicity prediction, advanced algorithms such as deep neural networks in environmental process studies of pollutants are still deficient. In addition, over 40% of the environmental applications of ML go to air pollution, and its application range and acceptance in other aspects of environmental science remain to be increased. The use of ML methods to revolutionize environmental science and its problem-solving scenarios has its own challenges. Several issues should be taken into consideration, such as the tradeoff between model performance and interpretability, prerequisites of the machine learning model, model selection, and data sharing.","This research was jointly supported by the project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91743204, 21825403, 21976194, 22193053, 21976206 and 92043302 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0907500 and 2018YFA0901101), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS (XDPB2005).",,Environmental Science and Technology,,Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Machine Learning,2022-01-27,2022,2022-01-27,2022-02-15,56,4,2124-2133,Closed,Article,"Liu, Xian; Lu, Dawei; Zhang, Aiqian; Liu, Qian; Jiang, Guibin","Liu, Xian (State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, People’s Republic of China); Lu, Dawei (State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, People’s Republic of China); Zhang, Aiqian (State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, People’s Republic of China; School of Environment, Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, 310012, People’s Republic of China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, People’s Republic of China; Institute of Environment and Health, Jianghan University, Wuhan, 430056, People’s Republic of China); Liu, Qian (State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, People’s Republic of China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, People’s Republic of China; Institute of Environment and Health, Jianghan University, Wuhan, 430056, People’s Republic of China); Jiang, Guibin (State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, People’s Republic of China; School of Environment, Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, 310012, People’s Republic of China)","Zhang, Aiqian (Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Jianghan University); Liu, Qian (Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Jianghan University)","Liu, Xian (Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences); Lu, Dawei (Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences); Zhang, Aiqian (Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Jianghan University); Liu, Qian (Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Jianghan University); Jiang, Guibin (Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)",30,30,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145040486,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

Therefore, an appropriate source identification was essential to reduce the ecological risk posed by the given pollutants. In this study, shallow and deep learning approaches trained by a registered environmental dataset of discharge sources were employed to classify the potential emission sources of trace metals in the Elbe River, Germany. The results showed that the overall concentration rank of the given metals was Zn (226.5 ± 526.5 μg·L-1) > Ni (5.6 ± 4.7 μg·L-1) > Cu (5.3 ± 5.8 μg·L-1) > As (3.3 ± 3.7 μg·L-1) > Pb (2.9 ± 5.2 μg·L-1) > Cr (1.8 ± 2.5 μg·L-1) > Cd (1.3 ± 3.1 μg·L-1) in seven tributaries and the mainstream of the Elbe River, among which the tributary Triebisch had the highest risk quotient over 86. Random Forest outperformed other algorithms with the highest Kappa median values of 0.59 and the lowest Hamming-loss values of 0.22 in extraction of the majority voted class. Then, the source apportionment conducted by random forest suggested that wastewater disposal and metal industrial emissions were the source contributors in the tributary Triebisch (probabilities: 0.39, 0.3), upstream segment (0.45, 0.25), and downstream segment (0.32, 0.23) of the given river. Additional sources of mineral industry emissions were found in the upstream segment (0.21) and downstream segment (0.22). The data provided herein suggest that random forest would be an effective approach to identify pollutants in aquatic environments and could assist source-oriented adaptive management.","The authors would like to gratefully thank the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the Saxony State Office for Environment, Agriculture and Geology (Sächsisches Landesamt für Umwelt, Landwirtschaft und Geologie) for providing data.

Water quality index (WQI) is an important dynamic attribute in the characterization of the Danube River ecosystems health and quality. The WQ index scores do not reflect the actual condition of water quality. We proposed a new forecast scheme for water quality based on the following qualitative classes very good (0-25), good (26-50), poor (51-75), very poor (76-100) and extremely polluted/non-potable (>100). Water quality forecasting by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a meaningful method of protecting public health because of its possibility to provide early warning regarding harmful water pollutants. The main objective of the present study is to forecast the WQI time series data based on water physical, chemical and flow status parameters and associated WQ index scores. The Cascade-forward network (CFN) models, along with the Radial Basis Function Network (RBF) as a benchmark model, were developed using data from 2011 to 2017 and WQI forecasts were produced for the period 2018-2019 at all sites. The nineteen input water quality features represent the initial dataset. Moreover, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm refines the initial dataset by selecting eight features considered the most relevant. Both datasets are employed for constructing the predictive models. According to the results of appraisal, the CFN models produced better outcomes (MSE = 0.083/0,319 and R-value 0.940/0.911 in quarter I/quarter IV) than the RBF models. In addition, results show that both the CFN and RBF models could be effective for predicting time series data for water quality when the eight most relevant features are used as input variables. Also, the CFNs provide the most accurate short-term forecasting curves which reproduce the WQI for the first and fourth quarters (the cold season). The second and third quarters presented a slightly lower accuracy. The reported results clearly demonstrate that CFNs successfully forecast the short-term WQI as they may learn historic patterns and determine the nonlinear relationships between the input and output variables.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Body part is a critical piece of information to facilitate both prefetching and hanging protocols, but body part information encoded using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard is widely variable, error-prone, not granular enough, or missing altogether. This results in inappropriate examinations being prefetched or relevant examinations left behind; hanging protocol optimization suffers as well. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly when harnessing federated deep learning techniques, allow for highly accurate automatic detection of body part based on the image data within a radiological examination; this allows for much more reliable implementation of this categorization and workflow.

Using glass slides of mice liver as a model for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a deep learning AI algorithm was developed. This algorithm uses a segmentation framework for vacuole quantification and can be deployed to analyze live histopathology fields during the microscope-based pathology assessment. We compared the manual semiquantitative microscope-based assessment with the quantitative output of the deep learning algorithm. The deep learning algorithm was able to recognize and quantify the percent of fatty vacuoles, exhibiting a strong and significant correlation (r = 0.87, P < .001) between the semiquantitative and quantitative assessment methods. The use of deep learning algorithms for difficult quantifications within the microscope-based pathology assessment can help improve outputs of toxicologic pathology workflows.","The authors would like to thank Augmentiqs for their assistance in integrating the AI algorithms within the Augmentiqs system, and Dr. Abraham Nyska would like to thank Augmentiqs for allowing him to serve as an unpaid scientific advisor.",,Toxicologic Pathology,,"Algorithms; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Disease Models, Animal; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Machine Learning; Mice; Microscopy; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Vacuoles",2020-06-08,2020,2020-06-08,2020-07,48,5,702-707,Closed,Article,"Ramot, Yuval; Zandani, Gil; Madar, Zecharia; Deshmukh, Sanket; Nyska, Abraham","Ramot, Yuval (The Faculty of Medicine, Hadassah Medical Center, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel); Zandani, Gil (Institute of Biochemistry, Food Science and Nutrition, Robert H.

For instance, smart wearable sensor-based behavior recognition system can observe elderly people in a smart eldercare environment to improve their lifestyle and can also help them by warning about forthcoming unprecedented events such as falls or other health risk, to prolong their independent life. Although there are many ways of using distinguished sensors to observe behavior of people, wearable sensors mostly provide reliable data in this regard to monitor the individual’s functionality and lifestyle. In this paper, we propose a body sensor-based activity modeling and recognition system using time-sequential information-based deep Neural Structured Learning (NSL), a promising deep learning algorithm. First, we obtain data from multiple wearable sensors while the subjects conduct several daily activities. Once the data is collected, the time-sequential information then go through some statistical feature processing. Furthermore, kernel-based discriminant analysis (KDA) is applied to see the better clustering of the features from different activity classes by minimizing inner-class scatterings while maximizing inter-class scatterings of the samples. The robust time-sequential features are then applied with Neural Structured Learning (NSL) based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for activity modeling. The proposed approach achieved around 99% recall rate on a public dataset. It is also compared to existing different conventional machine learning methods such as typical Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) where they yielded the maximum recall rate of 94%. Furthermore, a fast and efficient explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is used to explain and check the machine learning decisions. The robust activity recognition system can be adopted for understanding peoples' behavior in their daily life in different environments such as homes, clinics, and offices.","The authors thank Erik G.

In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML)-based approach to assess the ecological risk of contaminated sediment as an alternative to existing index-based methods and costly toxicity testing. The performance of three widely used index-based methods (the pollution load index, potential ecological risk index, and mean probable effect concentration) and three ML algorithms (random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting [XGB]) were compared in their prediction of sediment toxicity using 327 nationwide data sets from Korea consisting of 14 sediment quality parameters and sediment toxicity testing data. We also compared the performances of classifiers and regressors in predicting the toxicity for each of RF, SVM, and XGB algorithms. For all algorithms, the classifiers poorly classified toxic and non-toxic samples due to limited information on the sediment composition and the small training dataset. The regressors with a given classification threshold provided better classification, with the XGB regressor outperforming the other models in the classification. A permutation feature importance analysis revealed that Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn were major contributors to toxicity prediction. The ML-based approach has the potential to be even more useful in the future with the expected increase in available sediment data.","This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) of the Republic of Korea (NIER-SP2020-37).",,Environmental Pollution,,"China; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Lead; Machine Learning; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,2022-11,312,,120086,Closed,Article,"Ban, Min Jeong; Lee, Dong Hoon; Shin, Sang Wook; Kim, Keugtae; Kim, Sungpyo; Oa, Seong-Wook; Kim, Geon-Ha; Park, Yeon-Jeong; Jin, Dal Rae; Lee, Mikyung; Kang, Joo-Hyon","Ban, Min Jeong (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Dongguk University-Seoul, Seoul, 04620, Republic of Korea.); Lee, Dong Hoon (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Dongguk University-Seoul, Seoul, 04620, Republic of Korea.); Shin, Sang Wook (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Dongguk University-Seoul, Seoul, 04620, Republic of Korea.); Kim, Keugtae (Department of Environmental and Energy Engineering, The University of Suwon, 17 Wauan-gil, Bongdam-eup, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, 18323, Republic of Korea.); Kim, Sungpyo (Department of Environmental Engineering, Korea University-Sejong, 2 511, Sejong-ro, Sejong City, 30019, Republic of Korea.); Oa, Seong-Wook (Department of Railroad and Civil Engineering, Woosong University, Daejeon, 34606, Republic of Korea.); Kim, Geon-Ha (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hannam University, Daejeon, 34430, Republic of Korea.); Park, Yeon-Jeong (Water Environmental Engineering Research Division, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, 22689, Republic of Korea.); Jin, Dal Rae (Water Environmental Engineering Research Division, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, 22689, Republic of Korea.); Lee, Mikyung (Water Environmental Engineering Research Division, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, 22689, Republic of Korea.); Kang, Joo-Hyon (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Dongguk University-Seoul, Seoul, 04620, Republic of Korea.

The paper number, authors, institutions, corporations, publication sources, citations, and keywords are noted as sub/categories for the bibliometric analysis. Thematic LS data, including the study site, landslide inventory, conditioning factors, mapping unit, susceptibility models, and mode fit/prediction performance evaluation, are presented in the content analysis. Then, we reveal the advantages and limitations of the common approaches used in thematic LS data and summarise the development trends. The results indicate that the distribution of articles shows clear clusters of authors, institutions, and countries with high academic activity. The application of remote sensing technology for interpreting landslides provides a more convenient and efficient landslide inventory. In the landslide inventory, most of the sample strategies representing the landslides are point and polygon, and the most frequently used sample subdividing strategy is random sampling. The scale effects, lack of geographic consistency, and no standard are key problems in landslide conditioning factors. Feature selection is used to choose the factors that can improve the model’s accuracy. With advances in computing technology and artificial intelligence, LS models are changing from simple qualitative and statistical models to complex machine learning and hybrid models. Finally, five future research opportunities are revealed.

For outdoor plantation farms, the prediction of climate data, such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity, enables the planning and control of agricultural production to improve the yield and quality of crops. However, it is not easy to accurately predict climate trends because the sensing data are complex, nonlinear, and contain multiple components. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning predictor, in which an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is used to decompose the climate data into fixed component groups with different frequency characteristics, then a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is trained for each group as the sub-predictor, and finally the results from the GRU are added to obtain the prediction result. Experiments based on climate data from an agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) system verify the development of the proposed model.

However, plant stress may also be profitable since it behaves hormetically; at low doses, it stimulates positive traits in crops, such as the synthesis of specialized metabolites and additional stress tolerance. The controlled exposure of crops to low doses of stressors is therefore called hormesis management, and it is a promising method to increase crop productivity and quality. Nevertheless, hormesis management has severe limitations derived from the complexity of plant physiological responses to stress. Many technological advances assist plant stress science in overcoming such limitations, which results in extensive datasets originating from the multiple layers of the plant defensive response. For that reason, artificial intelligence tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have become crucial for processing and interpreting data to accurately model plant stress responses such as genomic variation, gene and protein expression, and metabolite biosynthesis. In this review, we discuss the most recent ML and DL applications in plant stress science, focusing on their potential for improving the development of hormesis management protocols.","We acknowledge Claudia Gutiérrez-Antonio for proofreading this manuscript and Marieke Vanthoor-Koopmans for revising this text for language use, grammar, and syntax.

However, they lead to the release of hydrogen sulfide. This in turn leads to the iron sulfide scale formation (pyrite). ATP sulfurylase is an enzyme present in SRB, which catalyzes the formation of adenylyl sulfate (APS) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPi) from ATP and sulfate. This reaction is the first among many in hydrogen sulfide production by D. postgatei . Consensus scoring using molecular docking and machine learning was used to identify three potential inhibitors of ATP sulfurylase from a database of about 40 million compounds. These selected hits ((S,E)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(9-((m-tolylimino)methyl)-9,10-dihydroanthracen-9-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione; methyl 2-[[(1S)-5-cyano-2-imino-1-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)-3-azaspiro[5.5]undec-4-en-4-yl]sulfanyl]acetate; and (4S)-4-(3-chloro-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-1-(6-hydroxypyridazin-3-yl)-3-methyl-4,5-dihydropyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-6-ol), known as A, B, and C, respectively) all had good binding affinities with ATP sulfurylase and were further analyzed for their toxicological properties. Compound A had the highest docking score. However, based on the physicochemical and toxicological properties, only compound C was predicted to be both safe and effective as a potential inhibitor of ATP sulfurylase, hence the preferred choice. The molecular interactions of compound C revealed favorable interactions with the following residues: LEU213, ASP308, ARG307, TRP347, LEU224, GLN212, MET211, and HIS309.",This work was supported by funding from NPRP Grant # 9-084-2-041 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation).

Total commitments from individuals and the entire community are the major challenges faced during treatment. This study investigated the progress of ART in the Federal Teaching Hospital in Gombe state, Nigeria by using various records of patients receiving treatment in the ART hospital unit. We combined artificial intelligence (AI)-based models and correspondence analysis (CA) techniques to predict and visualize the progress of ART from the beginning to the end. The AI models employed are artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) and support-vector machines (SVMs) and a classical linear regression model of multiple linear regression (MLR). According to the outcome of this study, ANFIS in both training and testing outperformed the remaining models given the R2 (0.903 and 0.904) and MSE (7.961 and 3.751) values, revealing that any increase in the number of years of taking ART medication will provide HIV/AIDS-treated patients with safer and elongated lives. The contingency results for the CA and the chi-square test did an excellent job of capturing and visualizing the patients on medication, which gave similar results in return, revealing there is a significant association between ART drugs and the age group, while the association between ART drugs and marital status (93.7%) explained a higher percentage of variation compared with the remaining variables.","The authors are grateful to Near East University, North Cyprus, Mersin-10, Türkiye, for supporting this study.",This research received no external funding.,Life,,,2023-03-06,2023,2023-03-06,,13,3,715,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bala, Kabiru; Etikan, Ilker; Usman, A.

India being the largest consumer of groundwater in the world, dwindling groundwater storage has emerged as a serious concern in recent years. Consequently, the judicious and efficient management of vital groundwater resources is one of the grand challenges in India. Groundwater modeling is a promising tool to develop sustainable management strategies for the efficient utilization of this treasured resource. This study demonstrates a pragmatic framework for predicting seasonal groundwater levels at a large scale using real-world data. Three relatively powerful Machine Learning (ML) techniques viz., ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were employed for predicting seasonal groundwater levels at the country scale using in situ groundwater-level and pertinent meteorological data of 1996-2016. ANFIS, DNN and SVM models were developed for 18 Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) of India and their efficacy was evaluated using suitable statistical and graphical indicators. The findings of this study revealed that the DNN model is the most proficient in predicting seasonal groundwater levels in most AEZs, followed by the ANFIS model. However, the prediction ability of the three models is 'moderate' to 'very poor' in 3 AEZs ['Western Plain and Kutch Peninsula' in Western India, and 'Deccan Plateau (Arid)' and 'Eastern Ghats and Deccan Plateau' in Southern India]. It is recommended that groundwater-monitoring network and data acquisition systems be strengthened in India in order to ensure efficient use of modeling techniques for the sustainable management of groundwater resources.","The authors are very thankful to the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions, which improved the previous version of this manuscript.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,2021-04-24,2021,2021-04-24,2021-09,785,,147319,Closed,Article,"Mohapatra, Janaki B; Jha, Piyush; Jha, Madan K; Biswal, Sabinaya","Mohapatra, Janaki B (AgFE Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721 302, India.); Jha, Piyush (University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada.); Jha, Madan K (AgFE Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721 302, India.

To support the extensive task of laboratory characterization, scientists may increasingly rely on data-driven rubrics or machine learning models that learn from known zoonoses to identify which animal pathogens could someday pose a threat to global health. We synthesize the findings of an interdisciplinary workshop on zoonotic risk technologies to answer the following questions. What are the prerequisites, in terms of open data, equity and interdisciplinary collaboration, to the development and application of those tools? What effect could the technology have on global health? Who would control that technology, who would have access to it and who would benefit from it? Would it improve pandemic prevention? Could it create new challenges?

The aim of this study is to obtain the most effective routine blood values (RBV) in the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 using a backward feature elimination algorithm for the LogNNet reservoir neural network. The first dataset in the study consists of a total of 5296 patients with the same number of negative and positive COVID-19 tests. The LogNNet-model achieved the accuracy rate of 99.5% in the diagnosis of the disease with 46 features and the accuracy of 99.17% with only mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and activated partial prothrombin time. The second dataset consists of a total of 3899 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who were treated in hospital, of which 203 were severe patients and 3696 were mild patients. The model reached the accuracy rate of 94.4% in determining the prognosis of the disease with 48 features and the accuracy of 82.7% with only erythrocyte sedimentation rate, neutrophil count, and C reactive protein features.

The S1 volumes can directly be obtained by Rock-Eval pyrolysis analysis. However, it is time consuming and not practical to obtain samples from all intervals of all wells in any shale play. S1 volumes prediction with a deep learning (DL) model have increasingly became important with the booming exploration and development of shale oil and gas resources. S1 volumes of shales are controlled by organic matter richness, type and maturity together with reservoir quality and adsorption capacity which are mainly effected by age, depth, organic content, maturity and mineralogy. A dataset consisting of 331 samples from 19 wells of various locations of the world-class organic-rich shales of the Niobrara, Eagle Ford, Barnett, Haynesville, Woodford, Vaca Muerta and Dadaş has been used to determination of a DL model for S1 volumes prediction using Python 3 programing environment with Tensorflow and Keras open-source libraries. The DL model that contains 5 dense layers and, 1024, 512, 256, 128 and 128 neurons has been predicted S1 volumes of shales as high as R2 = 0.97 from the standard petroleum E&P activities. The DL model has also successfully been applied to S1 volumes prediction of the Bakken and Marcellus shales of the North America. The prediction of the S1 volumes show that the shales have lower to higher reservoir quality and, oil and gas production rate that are well-matches with former studies.","This work was supported by Shalesys Energy (Grant No. 2022.1).

Advances in Continual Learning (CL) with recurrent neural networks could pave the way to a large number of applications where incoming data is non stationary, like natural language processing and robotics. However, the existing body of work on the topic is still fragmented, with approaches which are application-specific and whose assessment is based on heterogeneous learning protocols and datasets. In this paper, we organize the literature on CL for sequential data processing by providing a categorization of the contributions and a review of the benchmarks. We propose two new benchmarks for CL with sequential data based on existing datasets, whose characteristics resemble real-world applications. We also provide a broad empirical evaluation of CL and Recurrent Neural Networks in class-incremental scenario, by testing their ability to mitigate forgetting with a number of different strategies which are not specific to sequential data processing. Our results highlight the key role played by the sequence length and the importance of a clear specification of the CL scenario.",We thank the ContinualAI association and all of its members for the fruitful discussions.,,Neural Networks,,"Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer; Robotics",2021-07-22,2021,2021-07-22,2021-11,143,,607-627,All OA; Green,Article,"Cossu, Andrea; Carta, Antonio; Lomonaco, Vincenzo; Bacciu, Davide","Cossu, Andrea (University of Pisa, Largo B.

Experimental methods of determining oil viscosity, such as the rotational viscometer, are more accurate than other methods. The compositional method can also properly estimate oil viscosity. However, the composition of oil should be determined experimentally, which is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the occasional inaccessibility of experimental data may make it inevitable to look for convenient methods for fast and accurate prediction of oil viscosity. Hence, in this study, the error in viscosity prediction has been minimized by taking into account the amount of dissolved gas in oil (solution gas–oil ratio: Rs) as a representative of oil composition along with other conventional black oil features including temperature, pressure, and API gravity by employing recently developed machine learning methods based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT): extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), CatBoost, and GradientBoosting. Moreover, the advantage of the proposed method lies in its independence to input viscosity data in each pressure region/stage. The results were then compared with well-known correlations and machine-learning methods employing the black oil approach applying least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and compositional approach implementing decision trees (DTs). XGBoost is offered as the best method with its greater precision and lower error. It provides an overall average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 1.968% which has reduced the error of the compositional method by half and the black oil method (saturated region) by five times. This shows the proper viscosity prediction and corroborates the applied method's performance.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Scientific Reports,,,2023-01-30,2023,2023-01-30,,13,1,1666,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peiro Ahmady Langeroudy, Kiana; Kharazi Esfahani, Parsa; Khorsand Movaghar, Mohammad Reza","Peiro Ahmady Langeroudy, Kiana (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), 424 Hafez Avenue, Box 15875-4413, 1591634311, Tehran, Iran); Kharazi Esfahani, Parsa (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), 424 Hafez Avenue, Box 15875-4413, 1591634311, Tehran, Iran); Khorsand Movaghar, Mohammad Reza (Department of Petroleum Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), 424 Hafez Avenue, Box 15875-4413, 1591634311, Tehran, Iran)","Khorsand Movaghar, Mohammad Reza (Amirkabir University of Technology)","Peiro Ahmady Langeroudy, Kiana (Amirkabir University of Technology); Kharazi Esfahani, Parsa (Amirkabir University of Technology); Khorsand Movaghar, Mohammad Reza (Amirkabir University of Technology)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28770-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154943222,37 Earth Sciences; 3703 Geochemistry; 40 Engineering,

In this study, we provide comprehensive knowledge of drug distribution background, influencing factors, and artificial intelligence-based distribution property prediction models from 2019 to the present. Additionally, we gathered and analyzed public databases and datasets commonly utilized by the scientific community for distribution prediction. The distribution property prediction performance of five large ADMET prediction tools is mentioned as a benchmark for future research. On this basis, we also offer future challenges in drug distribution prediction and research directions.

Despite its high morbidity and socio-economic burden, therapeutics are just a handful with praziquantel being the main drug. Praziquantel is an old drug registered for human use in 1982 and has since been administered en masse for chemotherapy, risking the development of resistance, thus the need for new drugs with different mechanisms of action. This review examines the use of machine learning (ML) in this era of big data to aid in the prediction of novel antischistosomal molecules. It first discusses the challenges of drug discovery in schistosomiasis. Explanations are then offered for big data, its characteristics and then, some open databases where large biochemical data on schistosomiasis can be obtained for ML model development are examined. The concepts of artificial intelligence, ML, and deep learning and their drug applications are explored in schistosomiasis. The use of binary classification in predicting antischistosomal compounds and some algorithms that have been applied including random forest and naive Bayesian are discussed. For this review, some deep learning algorithms (deep neural networks) are proposed as novel algorithms for predicting antischistosomal molecules via binary classification. Databases specifically designed for housing bioactivity data on antischistosomal molecules enriched with functional genomic datasets and ontologies are thus urgently needed for developing predictive ML models.Graphic abstractThis shows the application of machine learning techniques for the discovery of novel antischistosomal small molecules via binary classification in the era of big data.",,The work was not funded.,Molecular Diversity,,Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Big Data; Humans; Machine Learning; Praziquantel; Schistosomiasis,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2022-06,26,3,1597-1607,Closed,Article,"Kwofie, Samuel K.; Agyenkwa-Mawuli, Kwasi; Broni, Emmanuel; Miller III, Whelton A.; Wilson, Michael D.","Kwofie, Samuel K.

At the same time, it is also an important way to realize intelligent management. Water pollution is serious all over the world, also the intelligent management of sewage treatment has always been one of the urgent problems to be solved. For this, an intelligent management system is designed in this study to realize automatic monitoring and intelligent decision-making of sewage treatment. However, the existing technology usually trains artificial intelligence models based on historical data, and such models have some limitations in describing nonlinear and complex wastewater treatment processes. Offline machine learning lacks dynamic adaptive characteristics to scene changes. Considering this, this paper designs an online learning-empowered smart management for A2/O process in sewage treatment processes (OL-AP). Online learning is based on the new data generated by the scene transformation, so that the model can learn again and give better results. In this study, relevant simulation experiments are carried out on the sewage treatment data of a sewage treatment plant in Chongqing. Firstly, automatic data collection is realized based on the sensor network of the IoT. Then, according to the preprocessed data, the designed prediction model is trained and a set of parameters with better evaluation indexes is obtained. Finally, online learning uses the latest data samples based on the online feedback of real scenes to optimize the model by retraining and adjusting parameters.","This work was supported in part by the Major project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission under grant KJZD-M202000801, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2016YFE0205600, in part by Innovation Group of New Technologies for Industrial Pollution Control of Chongqing Education Commission under Grant CXQT19023,and in part by the Key Research Project of Chongqing Technology and Business University under Grant 1952027 and 1856033.",,Environmental Research,,"Artificial Intelligence; Education, Distance; Intelligence; Machine Learning; Sewage",2022-02-24,2022,2022-02-24,2022-07,210,,113015,Closed,Article,"Fan, Yuqi; Guo, Zhiwei; Wang, Jianhui; Zhang, Bing; Shen, Yu; Gao, Xu","Fan, Yuqi (National Research Base of Intelligent Manufacturing Service, School of Management Science and Engineering, Chongqing Technology and Business University, Chongqing, 400067, China.

Pancreatic cancer diagnosis has been primarily based on imaging, but the current state-of-the-art imaging provides a poor prognosis, thus limiting clinicians' treatment options. The advancement of a cancer diagnosis has been enhanced through the integration of artificial intelligence and imaging modalities to make better clinical decisions. In this review, we examine how AI models can improve the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer using different imaging modalities along with a discussion on the emerging trends in an AI-driven diagnosis, based on cytopathology and serological markers. Ethical concerns regarding the use of these tools have also been discussed.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Nano Mission, Department of Science &amp; Technology and FIST, Department of Science &amp; Technology.

Therefore, its forecasting is critical for water managers and irrigation planners. In this study, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model has been hybridized by differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm as a novel approach to forecast monthly reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Furthermore, this model has been compared with the classic stochastic time series model. For this, the ET0 rates were calculated on a monthly scale during 1995–2018, based on FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation and meteorological data including minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, mean air temperature, minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity & sunshine duration. The investigation was performed on 6 stations in different climates of Iran, including Bandar Anzali & Ramsar (per-humid), Gharakhil (sub-humid), Shiraz (semi-arid), Ahwaz (arid), and Yazd (extra-arid). The models’ performances were evaluated by the criteria percent bias (PB), root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and Nash-Sutcliff (NS) coefficient. Surveys confirm the high capability of the hybrid ANFIS-DE model in monthly ET0 forecasting; so that the DE algorithm was able to improve the accuracy of ANFIS, by 16% on average. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) was the most suitable pattern among the time series stochastic models and superior to its competitors, ANFIS and ANFIS-DE. Consequently, the SARIMA was suggested more appropriate for monthly ET0 forecasting in all the climates, due to its simplicity and parsimony. Comparison between the different climates confirmed that the climate type significantly affects the forecasting accuracies: it’s revealed that all the models work better in extra-arid, arid and semi-arid climates, than the humid and per-humid areas.",The work was supported by the Bu-Ali Sina University Deputy of Research and Technology (Grant no. 1400-1066).
